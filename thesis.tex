\section{Standard Constructions}\label{chapter::constructions}
\begin{myparagraph}
This section introduces two standard constructions for microbundles, the `induced microbundle' and the `Whitney sum'. Both constructions have their vector bundle analogue and many results carry over immediately to microbundles.

\section{The Homotopy Theorem}\label{chapter::homotopy}
\begin{myparagraph}
In this section, we will prove the Homotopy Theorem, which is a fundamental result over microbundles. It states the following.
\end{myparagraph}
\input{src/sections/homotopy/parts/statement}
\begin{myparagraph}
In order to prove this theorem, we introduce the concept of map-germs over microbundles which provides another way to think about isomorphy besides \myintref{microbundle::isomorphy}.

\section{Rooted Microbundles and the Bouquet Lemma}\label{chapter::suspension}
\begin{myparagraph}
In this section, we provide a proof for the Bouquet Lemma stated in \myintref{section::whitney}. To this end, we introduce the concept of `rooted microbundles', which allows us to define the wedge sum of two microbundles in a precise manner. Additionally, we show a version of the Homotopy Theorem that is compatible with rooted-microbundles.

Throughout this section, we assume that every topological space is equipped with an arbitrary base point which we will denote with subscript $0$.
