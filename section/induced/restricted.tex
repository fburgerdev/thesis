\example{(restricted microbundle)}
\\ Let $\bundleb: \bundle{B}{E}{i}{j}$ be a microbundle and $A \subseteq B$:
\\ The induced microbundle $\iota^*\bundleb$ with $\iota: A \incl B$ being the inclusion map is called the \textdef{restricted microbundle} and we write $\bundleb \restrict{A} := \iota^*\bundleb$.
