% statement
\example{(restricted microbundle)} \\
Let $\bb: \bundle{B}{E}{i}{j}$ be a microbundle and $A \sub B$:
The induced microbundle $\iota^*\bb$ with $\iota: A \incl B$ being the inclusion map is called the \textdef{restricted microbundle} and
we write $\bb \restrict{A} := \iota^*\bb$.
% remark
\begin{remark}
In the following, we'll consider $E(\bb\restrict{A})$ a subset of $E(\bb)$.
This is justified because
$E(\bb\restrict{A}) = \{ (a, e) \in A \times E(\bb) \mid a = j(e) \} \cong \{ e \in E(\bb) \mid j(e) \in A \} \sub E(\bb)$.
