\example{(restricted microbundle)}
\\ Let $\bundleb: \bundle{B}{E}{i}{j}$ be a microbundle and $A \subseteq B$:
\\ The induced microbundle $\iota^*\bundleb$ with $\iota: A \incl B$ being the inclusion map is called the \textdef{restricted microbundle} and we write $\bundleb \restrict{A} := \iota^*\bundleb$.

\begin{remark}
In the following, we'll consider $E(\bundleb\restrict{A})$ a subset of $E(\bundleb)$.
This is justified because
$E(\bundleb\restrict{A}) = \{ (a, e) \in A \times E(\bundleb) \mid a = j(e) \} \cong \{ e \in E(\bundleb) \mid j(e) \in A \} \subseteq E(\bundleb)$.
