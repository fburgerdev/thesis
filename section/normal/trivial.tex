\definition{(product neighborhood)}
\\ Again, let $M$ and $N$ be two topological manifolds with $N \subseteq M$.
\\ We say that $N$ has a \textdef{product neighborhood} in $M$ if there exists a trivial normal microbundle of $N$ in $M$.

\lemma{(criteria for product neighborhoods)}
\\ A submanifold $N \subseteq M$ has a product neighborhood if and only if there exists a neighborhood $U$ of $N$ with $(U, M) \cong (M \times R^n, M \times 0)$.
\begin{proof}
This follows directly from the definition of normal microbundles and the criteria for trivial microbundles (NUMBER).
