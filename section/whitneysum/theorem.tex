\theorem{()}
\\ Let $\bb$ be a microbundle over a $d$-dimensional simplicial complex $B$.
\\ Then there exists a microbundle $\mathfrak{n}$ over $B$ so that the Whitney sum $\bb \oplus \mathfrak{n}$ is trivial.
\begin{proof}
We prove this theorem by induction over $d$.
\\ (Start of induction)
\\ A $1$-dimensional simplicial complex is just a bouquet of circles, therefore the start of induction follows directly from the bouquet lemma.   
\\ (Inductive Step)
\\ Let $B'$ be the $(d - 1)$-skeleton of $B$ and $\mathfrak{n}'$ it's corresponding microbundle so that $\bb \restrict{B'} \oplus \mathfrak{n}'$ is trivial.
