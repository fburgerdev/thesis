\definition{(induced microbundle)}
\\ Let $\mathfrak{b}: \bundle{B}{E}{i}{j}$ be a microbundle and $f: A \to B$ a continuous map.
\\ We can construct a microbundle $f^*\mathfrak{b}: \bundle{A}{E'}{i'}{j'}$ defined as follows:
\begin{itemize}
    \item $E' := \{ (a, e) \in A \times E \mid f(a) = j(e) \}$
    \item $i': A \to E'$ with $i'(a) := (a, (i \circ f)(a))$
    \item $j': E' \to A$ with $j'(a, e) := a$
\end{itemize}
We call $f^*\mathfrak{b}$ the \textdef{induced microbundle} of $\mathfrak{b}$ over $f$.
\begin{proof}
It is clear that $i'$ and $j'$ are continuous and that $id_A = j' \circ i'$.
\\ So it remains to be shown that $f^*\mathfrak{b}$ is locally trivial for every $a \in A$:
\begin{itemize}
    \item $U' := f^{-1}(U) \subseteq A$ is an open neighborhood of $a$.
    \item $V' := j'^{-1}(U') \subseteq E'$ is an open neighborhood of $i'(U')$.
    \item $\phi': V' \isomto U' \times \R^n, \phi'(a, e) := (a, \pi_2(\phi(e)))$ is a homeomorphism.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item $\phi'$ is well defined because $(a, e) \in V': j(e) = f(a) \in U \implies e \in V$.
        \item $\phi'$ is bijective with $\phi'^{-1}(a, v) = (a, \phi^{-1}(f(a), v))$.
        \item $\phi'$ and $\phi'^{-1}$ are continuous because it's components are.
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\end{proof}
