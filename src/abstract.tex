    This paper presents the concept of microbundles
    as introduced in 1964 by John Milnor.
    After showing some basic properties and constructions,
    including the induced microbundle and the Whitney sum,
    we discuss tangent- and normal microbundles
    over topological manifolds.
    We prove that for every microbundle over a
    simplicial complex, there exists an inverse in respect to the Whitney sum.
    Furthermore, we show that homotopic maps yield isomorphic induced microbundles.
    These results permit the proof
    that every topological submanifold $N \sub M$ has a normal microbundle
    in a stabilization $M \cross \R^q$ of the surrounding manifold.
