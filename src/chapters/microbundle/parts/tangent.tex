\begin{myexample}[tangent microbundle]{microbundle::tangent}
    % definition tangent
    The \defterm{tangent microbundle} $\bt_M$ over a topological $d$-manifold $M$ is a diagram
    \[ \bundle{M}{M \times M}{\Delta}{\pi_1} \]
    where $\Delta(m) := (m, m)$ is the diagonal map and $\pi_1(m_1, m_2) := m_1$ is the projection map on the first component.
    % proof tangent
    \begin{myproof}[that $\bt_M$ is a microbundle]
        Let $p \in M$ and $(U, \phi)$ be a chart over $p$.
        We construct a local trivialization
        % diagram
        \[\begin{tikzcd}
            & U \times U \ar[dr, "\pi_1"] \ar[dd, "{\psi}"] & \\
            U \ar[ur, "\Delta"] \ar[dr, "{(id, 0)}"'] & & U \\
            & U \times \R^d \ar[ur, "\pi_1"'] &
        \end{tikzcd}\]
        where $\psi(u, u') := (u, \phi(u) - \phi(u'))$.
        Homeomorphy of $\psi$ follows from homeomorphy of $\phi$ and commutativity of the diagram is seen with
        \[ \psi(\Delta(m)) = \psi(m, m) = (m, \phi(m) - \phi(m)) = (m, 0) = (id \times 0)(m)\]
        and
        \[ \pi_1(u, u') = u = \pi_1(u, \psi^{(2)}(u, u')) = \pi_1(\psi(u, u')). \]
        Hence, $(U, U \times U, \psi)$ meets all local triviality conditions of $p$ in $\bt_M$.
    \end{myproof}
