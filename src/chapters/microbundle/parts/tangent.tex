\begin{myparagraph}
    The following example is the microbundle analog
    to the tangent bundle over smooth manifolds.
\end{myparagraph}

% example
\begin{myexample}[tangent microbundle]{microbundle::tangent}{}
    The \defterm{tangent microbundle} $\bt_M$ over a topological $d$-manifold $M$ is a diagram
    \[ \bundle{M}{M \times M}{\Delta}{\pi_1} \]
    where $\Delta(m) := (m, m)$ denotes the diagonal map.
\end{myexample}

% proof
\begin{myproof}[that $\bt_M$ is a microbundle]
    The maps $\Delta$ and $\pi_1$ are continuous and clearly $id_M = \pi_1 \circ \Delta$.

    Let $p \in M$ be arbitrary and let $(U, \psi)$ be a chart over $p$.
    Note that $U$ is an open neighborhood of $p$.
    
    We have a local trivialization $(U, U \times U, \phi)$ of $p$ in $\bt_M$ where
    \[ \phi: U \times U \isomto U \times \R^n \twith \phi(u, u') := (u, \psi(u) - \psi(u')). \]
    Homeomorphy of $\phi$ is given by homeomorphy of $\psi$.

    Lastly, $\phi$ commutes with injection
    \[ \phi(\Delta(m)) = \phi(m, m) = (m, \psi(m) - \psi(m)) = (m, 0) = (id \times 0)(m)\]
    and projection maps
    \[ \pi_1(u, u') = u = \pi_1(u, \snd{\phi}(u, u')) = \pi_1(\phi(u, u')). \]
    which concludes the proof.
\end{myproof}

% remark
\begin{myremark}{microbundle::tangentdim}{}
    Note that the tangent microbundle $\bt_M$ has fibre dimension $d$.
\end{myremark}

% afterword
\begin{myparagraph}
    The definition of the tangent microbundle
    takes use of the intuitive approach to define a tangent vector
    using the difference $\psi(p) - \psi(p')$ in euclidean space.
    Note that the tangent vector is hence dependant
    on the choice of the chart used.
    However this causes no problems since
    for microbundles one doesn't have global trivializations anyway.
