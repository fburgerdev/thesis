    The following example acts as the microbundle analog to the tangent bundle on a smooth manifold.
\end{myparagraph}

% tangent microbundle
\begin{myexample}[tangent microbundle]{microbundle::tangent}
    % def: tangent microbundle
    The \defterm{tangent microbundle} $\bt_M$ over a topological $d$-manifold $M$ is a diagram
    \[ \bundle{M}{M \times M}{\Delta}{\pi_1} \]
    where $\Delta(m) := (m, m)$ is the diagonal map and $\pi_1(m_1, m_2) := m_1$ is the projection map on the first component.
    % proof: microbundle properties
    \begin{myproof}[that $\bt_M$ is a microbundle]
        Let $p \in M$ and $(U, \phi)$ be a chart over $p$.
        We explicitly construct a local trivialization
        % diagram
        \[\begin{tikzcd}
            & U \times U \ar[dr, "\pi_1"] \ar[dd, "{\psi}"] & \\
            U \ar[ur, "\Delta"] \ar[dr, "{(0, id)}"'] & & U \\
            & U \times \R^d \ar[ur, "\pi_1"'] &
        \end{tikzcd}\]
        where $\psi(u, \tilde{u}) := (u, \phi(u) - \phi(\tilde{u}))$.
        It's obvious that $(U, U \times U, \psi)$ meets all local triviality conditions.
    \end{myproof}
