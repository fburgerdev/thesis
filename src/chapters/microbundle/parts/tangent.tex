\begin{myparagraph}
    The following example is our microbundle analog
    to the tangent bundle over smooth manifolds,
    hence being of significant interest.
\end{myparagraph}

% example
\begin{myexample}[tangent microbundle]{microbundle::tangent}
    The \defterm{tangent microbundle} $\bt_M$ over a topological $d$-manifold $M$ is a diagram
    \[ \bundle{M}{M \times M}{\Delta}{\pi_1} \]
    where $\Delta(m) := (m, m)$ denotes the diagonal map.
\end{myexample}

% proof
\begin{myproof}[that $\bt_M$ is a microbundle]
    The maps $\Delta$ and $\pi_1$ are continuous and clearly $id_M = \pi_1 \circ \Delta$.

    Let $p \in M$ be arbitrary and let $(U, \psi)$ be a chart over $p$.
    Note that $U$ is an open neighborhood of $p$.
    
    We have a local trivialization $(U, U \times U, \phi)$ of $p$ in $\bt_M$ where
    \[ \phi: U \times U \isomto U \times \R^n \twith \phi(u, u') := (u, \psi(u) - \psi(u')). \]
    Homeomorphy of $\phi$ is given by homeomorphy of $\psi$.

    Lastly, $\phi$ commutes with injection
    \[ \phi(\Delta(m)) = \phi(m, m) = (m, \psi(m) - \psi(m)) = (m, 0) = (id \times 0)(m)\]
    and projection maps
    \[ \pi_1(u, u') = u = \pi_1(u, \snd{\phi}(u, u')) = \pi_1(\phi(u, u')). \]
    which concludes the proof.
\end{myproof}

% remark
\begin{myremark}{microbundle::tangentdim}
    Note that the tangent microbundle $\bt_M$ has fibre dimension $d$.
