% foreword example
\begin{myparagraph}
    The most obvious example for a microbundle is the standard microbundle.
\end{myparagraph}

% ex: trivial microbundle
\begin{myexample}[trivial microbundle]{microbundle::trivial}
    For a topological space $B$, the \defterm{standard microbundle} $\be_B$ over $B$ is a diagram
    \[ \bundle{B}{B \times \R^n}{\iota}{\pi} \]
    where $\iota(b) := (b, 0)$ and $\pi(b, x) := b$.
    Additionally, a microbundle $\bb$ over $B$ is \defterm{trivial} if it is isomorphic to $\be_B$.
\end{myexample}

% foreword lemma
\begin{myparagraph}
    In order to make it easier classifying microbundles as trivial,
    we provide a sharper description of what it means for a microbundle to be trival. 
\end{myparagraph}

% lemma: sharper description for triviality
\begin{mylemma}{microbundle::triviallemma}
    A microbundle $\bb$ over a paracompact space $B$ is trivial if and only if there exists an open neighborhood $U$ of $i(B)$ such that $U \cong B \times \R^n$.
\end{mylemma}
% proof
\begin{myproof}
    By applying \intref{microbundle::total}, we may assume that $E(\bb)$ is an open subset of $B \times \R^n$.
    Since $B$ is paracompact, there exists a map $\lambda: B \to (0, 1]$ such that every $(b, x) \in B \times \R^n$ with $\abs{x} < \lambda(b)$ lies in $E(\bb)$.
    Now, the function
    \[ (b, x) \mapsto (b, \frac{x}{\abs{x} - \lambda(b)}) \]
    maps the open set $\{(b, x) \mid \abs{x} < \lambda(b)\}$ homeomorphically to $B \times \R^n$.
    By considering $\{(b, x) \mid \abs{x} < \lambda(b)\} \sub E(\bb)$, this completes the proof.
\end{myproof}
