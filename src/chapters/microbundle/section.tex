\chapter{Introduction to Microbundles}\label{chapter::microbundle}
\begin{myparagraph}
    In order to construct the tangent bundle on a manifold, we need a differential structure.
    However, this is generally not given for topological manifolds.
    In order to still have a structure ``similar'' to the tangent bundle on topological manifolds,
    we need a different, weaker, concept of the tangent bundle.
    Therefore we introduce so called ``microbundles'' which act as a weaker alternative to vector bundles.
    The concept of microbundles as well as some basic properties and examples are presented in this chapter.

    Now that we introduced the basic concept of microbundles, we will take a look at some key examples.
