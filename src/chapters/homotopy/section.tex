\chapter{The Homotopy Theorem}
\begin{myparagraph}
    In this chapter we prove the homotopy theorem.
    It states that the induced microbundles $f^*\bb$ and $g^*\bb$ of homotopic mappings $f$ and $g$ are isomorphic.
    Before proving this theorem, we introduce several new concepts which, for example, present us a new perspective on isomorphy between microbundles.
