\chapter{The Homotopy Theorem}
\begin{myparagraph}
    In this chapter we will prove the homotopy theorem.
    It states the following:
    % It states that the induced microbundles $f^*\bb$ and $g^*\bb$ over an arbitray microbundle $\bb$ are isomorphic, if the maps $f$ and $g$ are homotopic.
    % Before proving this theorem, we introduce several new concepts which, for example, present us a new perspective on isomorphy between microbundles.
