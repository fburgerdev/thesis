\begin{mystatement}{lemma}{homotopy::paracompact}
    Let $B$ be a paracompact hausdorff space and let $\coll{V_\alpha}$
    be a locally finite open cover of $B$.
    Then there exists a locally finite closed cover $\coll{\overline{B_\beta}}$ of $B$
    such that every $\overline{B_\beta}$ intersects only with
    finitely many $V_{\alpha_1}, \dots V_{\alpha_n}$.
\end{mystatement}

% proof
\begin{myproof}
    For every $b \in B$, there exists an open neighborhood $U_b$ of $b$ that intersects only with finitely many
    \[ V_{\alpha_1}, \dots V_{\alpha_k} \]
    using the definition of local finiteness for $\coll{V_\alpha}$.
    Clearly, the collection $\coll{U_b}$ over all $b \in B$ covers $B$.

    Since $B$ is paracompact, there exists a locally finite subcover $\coll{B_\beta}$.

    Now we have the collection $\coll{\overline{B_\beta}}$ that meets our requirements:
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item $\coll{\overline{B_\beta}}$ is locally finite:
        
        For an arbitrary $b \in B$, let $W_b$
        be an open neighborhood of $b$ that intersects only finitely many $B_{\beta_1}, \dots, B_{\beta_k}$.
        Now $W_b$ intersects only $\overline{B_{\beta_1}}, \dots, \overline{B_{\beta_1}}$ from $\coll{B_\beta}$, because
        \[ W_b \cap B_\beta = \emptyset \]
        \[ \implies B_\beta \sub B - W_b \]
        \[ \implies \overline{B_\beta} \sub \overline{B - W_b} = B - W_b \]
        \[ \implies W_b \cap \overline{B_\beta} = \emptyset \]

        \item Every $\overline{B_\beta}$ intersects only finitely many $V_\alpha$
        
        Since $B_\beta \sub U_b$ for some $b \in B$, $B_\beta$ intersects only finitely many $V_\alpha$.
        Using the same arguments as in 1., it follows that $\overline{B_\beta}$ intersects with the exact same $V_\alpha$.
    \end{enumerate}
\end{myproof}
