\begin{mydefinition}[bundle-germ]
    Let $\bb$ and $\bb'$ be two microbundles over $B$ (with the same fibre-dimension).
    A \defterm{bundle-germ} $F: \bb \double \bb'$ is a map-germ
    \[ F: (E, B) \double (E', B) \]
    such that it's representatives $f: U_f \to E'$ map each fibre $j^{-1}(b)$ injectively into a fibre $j'^{-1}(b')$.
