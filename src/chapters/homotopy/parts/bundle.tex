% foreword
\begin{myparagraph}
    We can take this even further by giving up on the assumption that the base spaces of the considered microbundles equal.
    Note that in this case no comparison to isomorphy can be drawn,
    since we have not defined isomorphy between microbundles over different base spaces.
\end{myparagraph}

% definition
\begin{mydefinition}[bundle-germ]{homotopy::bundle}
    Let $\bb$ and $\bb'$ be two microbundles with the same fibre-dimension.
    A \defterm{bundle-germ} $F: \bb \double \bb'$ is a map-germ
    \[ F: (E, B) \double (E', B') \]
    such that there exists a representative $f: U_f \to E'$ that maps each fibre $j^{-1}(b)$ injectively to a fibre $j'^{-1}(b')$.
\end{mydefinition}

% afterword
\begin{myparagraph}
    For a bundle-germ $F: \bb \double \bb'$, the following diagram commutes:
    \begin{center}
        \begin{tikzcd}
            (E, B) \arrow[r, Rightarrow, "F"] \ar[d, "i"] & (E', B') \ar[d, "i'"] \\
            B \ar[r, "F\vert_B"] & B' \\
        \end{tikzcd}
    \end{center}
    We say $F$ \defterm{is covered by} $F\restr{B}$.
