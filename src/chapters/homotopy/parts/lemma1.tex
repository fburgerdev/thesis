    % foreword
    \begin{myparagraph}
        Using the previous lemma,
        we can show a criteria on whether a microbundle
        over a cylinder base space is trivial.        
    \end{myparagraph}

    % lemma
    \begin{mystatement}{lemma}{homotopy::lemma1}
        Let $\bb$ be a microbundle over $\cyl{B}$. If $\bbleft$ and $\bbright$ are both trivial,
        then $\bb$ itself is trivial.
    \end{mystatement}

    % proof
    \begin{myproof}
        Consider the identity bundle-germ over $\bbhalf$, that is the bundle-germ represented by the identity on $E(\bbhalf)$.
        Since $\bbright$ is trivial, we can extend this bundle-germ to 
        \[ \germ{\bbright}{\bbhalf} \]
        by the representative
        \[ B \cross [\half, 1] \cross \R^n \to B \cross \coll{\half} \cross \R^n \]
        \[ (b, t, x) \mapsto (b, \half, x). \]
        Here we identified an open subset of $E(\bb[B \cross [\half, 1]])$ with $B \cross [\half, 1] \cross \R^n$ using \intref{microbundle::paracompact}.
        Using the previous lemma, we can piece this together with the identity bundle-germ on $\bbleft$ (note that the bundle-germs agree on their intersection) resulting in a bundle-germ
        \[ \germ{\bb}{\bbleft}. \]

        The previous corollary infers that $\bb$ is isomorphic to $\ind{r}\bbleft$ where $r: B \cross [0, 1]$ is the retraction $(b, t) \mapsto (b, \min(t, \half))$.
        But $\bbleft$ is trivial, hence $\ind{r}\bbleft$ is trivial as well (\intref{induced::trivial}) which concludes the proof.
    \end{myproof}
