\begin{myparagraph}
    The following lemma will allow us to glue
    together bundle-germs over locally finite, closed domains if they agree on their intersection.
\end{myparagraph}

% lemma
\begin{mylemma}{homotopy::glueing}{}
    % conditions
    Let $\bb$ be a microbundle over $B$ and $\coll{B_\alpha}$ a locally finite collection of closed sets covering $B$.
    Additionally, we are given a collection of bundle-germs $\germdef{F_\alpha}{\bb\restr{B_\alpha}}{\bb'}$
    such that $F_\alpha = F_\beta$ on $\bb\restr{B_\alpha \cap B_\beta}$.
    % conclusion
    Then there exists a bundle-germ $\germdef{F}{\bb}{\bb'}$ extending $F_\alpha$,
    that is $F$ and $F_\alpha$ agree on a sufficiently small neighborhood of $i(B_\alpha)$.
\end{mylemma}

% proof
\begin{myproof}
    Choose representative maps $f_\alpha: U_\alpha \to E(\bb')$ for $F_\alpha$ such that the $U_\alpha$ are open.
    For every $\alpha$ and $\beta$, choose an open neighborhood $U_{\alpha\beta}$ of $i(B_\alpha \cap B_\beta)$ on which the representative maps $f_\alpha$ and $f_\beta$ agree.
    Now consider
    \[ U := \set{ e \in E}{j(e) \in B_\alpha \cap B_\beta \implies e \in U_{\alpha\beta}} \]
    which satisfies the following:
    \begin{enumerate}
        % open
        \item $U$ is open:

        We can express $U$ like this:
        \[ E - \bigcup_{\alpha\beta} \{ \inv{j}(B_\alpha \cap B_\beta) \cap \cmpl{U_{\alpha\beta}} \} \]
        
        Since $\inv{j}(B_\alpha \cap B_\beta)$ and $\cmpl{U_{\alpha\beta}}$ are closed sets, $U$ must be open.
        That is because an open set remains open after removing arbitrarily many closed sets.
        % subset
        \item $i(B) \sub U$:
        
        This follows from
        \[ b \in B_\alpha \cap B_\beta \implies i(b) \in i(B_\alpha \cap B_\beta) \sub U_{\alpha\beta} \]
        and $j(i(b)) = b$.
    \end{enumerate}
    Now we can define $f: U \to E(\bb')$ in the obvious way
    \[ f(u \in U_{\alpha\beta}) := f_\alpha(u) = f_\beta(u) \]
    which is continuous according to the \extref{glueing lemma}.
    We see that $f$ agrees with $f_\alpha$ on $U_{\alpha\alpha}$,
    hence $f$ is a representative for a bundle-germ $\germdef{F}{\bb}{\bb'}$ extending $\coll{F_\alpha}$.
    
    Therefore, $f$ is a representative map for our required $F$.
\end{myproof}
