\begin{mylemma}{homotopy::glueing}
    Let $\bb$ be a microbundle over $B$ and $\{B_\alpha\}$ a locally finite collection of closed sets covering $B$.
    Additionally, we are given a collection of bundle map-germs $\bgerm{F_\alpha}{\bb\restr{B_\alpha}}{\bb'}$
    such that $F_\alpha = F_\beta$ on $\bb\restr{B_\alpha \cap B_\beta}$.
    Then there exists a bundle map-germ $\bgerm{F}{\bb}{\bb'}$ extending $F_\alpha$.
\end{mylemma}
% proof
\begin{myproof}
    Choose representative maps $f_\alpha: U_\alpha \to E'$ for $F_\alpha$ such that the $U_\alpha$ are open.
    For every $\alpha$ and $\beta$, choose a neighborhood $U_{\alpha\beta}$ of $i(B_\alpha \cap B_\beta)$ on which the representative maps $f_\alpha$ and $f_\beta$ agree.
    Now consider
    \[ U := \{ e \in E \mid j(e) \in B_\alpha \cap B_\beta \implies e \in U_{\alpha\beta} \}\]
    which satisfies the following:
    \begin{enumerate}
        % open
        \item $U$ is open.

        We can express $U$ like this:
        \[ E - \bigcup_{\alpha\beta} \{ j^{-1}(B_\alpha \cap B_\beta) \cap U_{\alpha\beta}^c \} \]
        
        Since $j^{-1}(B_\alpha \cap B_\beta)$ and $U_{\alpha\beta}^c$ are closed sets, $U$ must be open.
        That is because an open set remains open after removing arbitrary closed sets.
        % subset
        \item $i(B) \sub U$.
        
        This follows from
        \[ b \in B_\alpha \cap B_\beta \implies i(b) \in i(B_\alpha \cap B_\beta) \sub U_{\alpha\beta} \]
        and $j(i(b)) = b$.
    \end{enumerate}
    With the construction of $U$, we can define $f: U \to E'$ in the obvious way
    \[ f(u \in U_{\alpha\beta}) := f_\alpha(u) = f_\beta(u) \]
    which is a representative map for our desired $F$.
