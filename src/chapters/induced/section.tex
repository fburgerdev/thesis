\chapter{Induced Microbundles}\label{chapter::induced}
\begin{myparagraph}
    In this chapter we introduce induced microbundles,
    analogous to induced (or pullback) vector bundles.
    As we will see in the course of the chapter,
    we can show that many statements that are true for
    induced vector bundles are also true for induced microbundles.
    After showing some basic properties,
    we will study induced microbundles over cones and simplices.

\begin{myparagraph}
    Next, we provide two criteria for showing that an induced microbundle is trivial.
