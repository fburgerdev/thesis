\begin{mystatement}{lemma}{induced::trivial}
    Let $\bb$ be a microbundle over $B$ and $f: A \to B$ be a map.
    The induced microbundle $\ind{f}\bb$ is trivial if $\bb$ is already trivial.
\end{mystatement}

% proof
\begin{myproof}
    % explanation
    To proof triviality, we need to show that there exists a homeomorphism between a neighborhood of $i'(A)$ and $\cyldown{A}$
    that commutes with the injection and projection maps of $\ind{f}\bb$ and $\be{A}$.
    
    % homeomorphism
    Since $\bb$ is trivial, there exists a homeomorphism $\psi: V \to \psi(V)$
    where $V$ is a neighborhood of $i(B)$ and $\psi(V)$ is a neighborhood of $B \cross \{0\}$
    such that $\psi$ commutes with injection and projection maps.
    We define a map 
    \[ \psi': V' \isomto \psi'(V') \]
    \[ (a, e) \mapsto (a, \snd{\psi}(e)) \]
    where $V' := (A \cross V) \cap E(\ind{f}\bb)$.
    Since $\psi'$ is component-wise homeomorphic, $\psi'$ is a homeomorphism.
    Note that $V'$ is a neighborhood of $i'(A)$ since
    \[ \forall a \in A: i(f(a)) \in V \tand i'(a) = (a, i(f(a))). \]
    From $\snd{\psi}(i(f(a))) = 0$ and homeomorphy of $\psi'$ it follows that $\psi'(V')$ is a neighborhood of $\cyldown{A}$.

    % commute
    Finally, $\psi'$ commutes with the injection
    \[ \psi'(i'(a)) = (a, \snd{\psi}(i(f(a)))) = (a, 0) = (id \cross 0)(a) \]
    and projection maps
    \[ j'(a, e) = j'(a) = \pi_1(a, \snd{\psi'}(a, e)) = \pi_1(\psi'(a, e)) \]
    which completes the proof.
