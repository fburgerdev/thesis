% lemma trivial
\begin{mylemma}{induced::trivial}
    Let $\bb$ be a microbundle over $B$ and $f: A \to B$ be a map.
    The induced microbundle $f^*\bb$ is trivial if $\bb$ is already trivial.
\end{mylemma}

% proof trivial
\begin{myproof}
    To proof triviality, we need to show that there exists a homeomorphism between a neighborhood of $i'(A)$ and $A \times \{0\}$
    that commutes with the injection and projection maps of $f^*\bb$ and $\be_A$.
    
    % homeomorphism
    Since $\bb$ is trivial, there exists a homeomorphism $\psi: V \to \psi(V)$
    where $V$ is a neighborhood of $i(B)$ and $\psi(V)$ is a neighborhood of $B \times \{0\}$
    such that $\psi$ commutes with injection and projection maps.
    We define a map 
    \[ \psi': V' \isomto \psi'(V') \]
    \[ (a, e) \mapsto (a, \psi^{(2)}(e)) \]
    where $V' := (A \times V) \cap E(f^*\bb)$.
    Since $\psi'$ is component-wise homeomorphic, $\psi'$ is a homeomorphism.
    Note that $V'$ is a neighborhood of $i'(A)$ since $\forall a \in A: i(f(a)) \in V$ and $i'(a) = (a, i(f(a)))$.
    From $\psi^{(2)}(i(f(a))) = 0$ and homeomorphy of $\psi'$ it follows that $\psi'(V')$ is a neighborhood of $A \times \{0\}$.

    % commute
    Finally, $\psi'$ commutes with injection
    \[ \psi'(i'(a)) = (a, \psi^{(2)}(i(f(a)))) = (a, 0) = i_{\be_A}(a) \]
    and projection maps
    \[ j'(a, e) = j'(a) = j_{\be_A}(a, \psi'^{(2)}(a, e)) = j_{\be_A}(\psi'(a, e)) \]
    which completes the proof.
\end{myproof}

% lemma const
\begin{mylemma}{induced::const}
    Let $\bb$ be a microbundle over $B$. The induced microbundle $const_{b_0}^*\bb$ over a map
    \[ const_{b_0}: A \to B \twith const_{b_0}(a) = b_0 \]
    is trivial.
\end{mylemma}

% proof const
\begin{myproof}
    The total space $E(const_{b_0}^*\bb)$ is of the form
    \[ \set{(a, e) \in A \times E(\bb)}{f(a) = b_0 = j(e)} \]
    \[ = A \times j^{-1}(b_0). \]
    By choosing a local trivialization $(U, V, \phi)$ of $b_0$ in $\bb$ and restricting $\phi$ to $j^{-1}(b_0)$,
    we receive a homeomorphism $\phi\restr{j^{-1}(b_0)}: V' \isomto b_0 \times \R^n$ where $V' := V \cap j^{-1}(b_0)$.
    
    With $\phi$ and $V'$ we can construct a homeomorphism $\psi: A \times V' \isomto A \times \R^n$ with
    \[ \psi(a, e) := (a, \phi^{(2)}(e)). \]
    Homeomorphy follows from component-wise homeomorphy of $\psi$.

    The map commutes with injection
    \[ \psi(i'(a)) = \psi(a, i(b_0)) = (a, \phi^{(2)}(i(b_0))) = (a, 0) = i_{\be_A}(a) \]
    and projection maps
    \[ j'(a, e) = a = j_{\be_A}(a, x) = j_{\be_A}(\psi(a, e)) \]
    which completes the proof
\end{myproof}
