    The following lemma shows that the induced microbundle
    is compatible with composition of maps.
\end{myparagraph}

% lemma
\begin{mylemma}{induced::composition}{}
    Let $\bundledef{\bc}{C}{E}{i}{j}$ be a microbundle and let $A \xto{f} B \xto{g} C$ be a map diagram.
    Then the two microbundles
    \[ \bundledef{\ind{(g \circ f)}\bc}{A}{E_1}{i_1}{j_1} \]
    and
    \[ \bundledef{\ind{f}(\ind{g}\bc)}{A}{E_2}{i_2}{j_2} \]
    are isomorphic.
\end{mylemma}

% proof
\begin{myproof}
    % foreword
    Again, we need to find a homeomorphism between a neighborhood of $i_1(A)$ and a neighborhood of $i_2(A)$
    that commutes with injection and projection maps.
    
    % homoemorphism
    First, compare the two total spaces:
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item $E_1 = \{ (a, e) \in A \times E \mid g(f(a)) = j(e)\}$ 
        \item $E_2 = \{ (a, b, e) \in A \times (B \times E) \mid f(a) = b$ and $ g(b) = j(e) \}$
    \end{enumerate}
    We construct a bijection $\psi: E_1 \isomto E_2$ with
    \[ \psi(a, e) = (a, f(a), e) \tand \inv{\psi}(a, b, e) = (a, e).\]
    Since both $\psi$ and $\inv{\psi}$ are component-wise continuous, it follows that $\psi$ is a homeomorphism.

    % commute
    This homeomorphism commutes with injection
    \[ \psi(i_1(a)) = \psi(a, i(g(f(a)))) = (a, f(a), i(g(f(a)))) = i_2(a) \]
    and projection maps
    \[ j_1(a, e) = a = j_2(a, f(a), e) = j_2(\psi(a, e)) \]
    which concludes the proof.
\end{myproof}
