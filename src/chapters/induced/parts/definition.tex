\begin{mydefinition}[induced microbundle]{induced::definition}
    Let $\bb: \bundle{B}{E}{i}{j}$ be a microbundle and $f: A \to B$ be a map.
    The \defterm{induced microbundle} $\bundledef{f^*\bb}{A}{E'}{i'}{j'}$ is a microbundle defined as follows:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item $E' := \{ (a, e) \in A \times E \mid f(a) = j(e) \}$
        \item $i': A \to E'$ with $i'(a) := (a, (i \circ f)(a))$
        \item $j': E' \to A$ with $j'(a, e) := a$
    \end{itemize}
\end{mydefinition}
% proof
\begin{myproof}[that $f^*\bb$ is a microbundle]
    % continuity and compatibility
    Both $i'$ and $j'$ are continuous since they are composed by continuous functions
    Additionally, $j'(i'(a)) = j'(a, i(f(a))) = a$ and hence $j' \circ i' = id_A$.

    % local triviality
    It remains to be shown that $f^*\bb$ is locally trivial:

    For an arbitrary $a_0 \in A$, choose a local trivialization $(U, V, \phi)$ of $i(a_0)$ in $\bb$.
    We construct a local trivialization of $a_0$ in $f^*\bb$ as follows:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item $U' := f^{-1}(U) \sub A$
        \item $V' := (U' \times V) \cap E' \sub E'$
        \item $\phi': V' \isomto U' \times \R^n$ with $\phi'(a, e) := (a, \phi^{(2)}(e))$
    \end{itemize}
    Note that $U'$ is an open neighborhood of $a_0$ since $f$ is continuous and $U$ is an open neighborhood of $i(a_0)$.
    Similarly, $V'$ is an open neighborhood of $i'(a_0)$ since both $U' \times V$ and $E'$ are open neighborhoods of $i'(a_0)$.
    The map $\phi'$ is well-defined because $(a, e) \in V' \implies e \in V$.
    The existence of an inverse $\phi'^{-1}(a, v) = (a, \phi^{-1}(f(a), v))$ and component-wise continuity show that $\phi'$ is a homeomorphism.
    This completes the proof.
