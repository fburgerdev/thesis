% def: restricted microbundle
\begin{myexample}[restricted microbundle]{induced::restricted}    
    Let $\bb: \bundle{B}{E}{i}{j}$ be a microbundle and $A \sub B$ be a subspace.
    The \defterm{restricted microbundle} $\bb\restr{A}$ is the induced microbundle $\iota^*\bb$ where $\iota: A \incl B$ is the inclusion map.
\end{myexample}

% rmk: total space
\begin{remark}{induced::total}
    In the following we consider $E(\bb\restr{A})$ a subset of $E(\bb)$.
    This is justified because there exists an embedding
    \[ \iota: E(\bb\restr{A}) \to E(\bb), (a, e) \mapsto e \]
    into the total space $E(\bb)$.
