% lemma
\begin{mylemma}{induced::const}{}
    Let $\bb$ be a microbundle over $B$. The induced microbundle $\ind{const_{b_0}}\bb$ over a map
    \[ const_{b_0}: A \to B \twith const_{b_0}(a) = b_0 \]
    is trivial.
\end{mylemma}

% proof
\begin{myproof}
    The total space $E(\ind{const_{b_0}}\bb)$ is of the form
    \[ \set{(a, e) \in A \times E(\bb)}{f(a) = b_0 = j(e)} \]
    \[ = A \times \inv{j}(b_0). \]
    By choosing a local trivialization $(U, V, \phi)$ of $b_0$ in $\bb$ and restricting $\phi$ to $\inv{j}(b_0)$,
    we receive a homeomorphism $\phi\restr{\inv{j}(b_0)}: V' \isomto b_0 \times \R^n$ where $V' := V \cap \inv{j}(b_0)$.
    
    With $\phi$ and $V'$ we can construct a homeomorphism $\psi: A \times V' \isomto A \times \R^n$ with
    \[ \psi(a, e) := (a, \snd{\phi}(e)). \]
    Homeomorphy follows from component-wise homeomorphy of $\psi$.

    The map commutes with injection
    \[ \psi(i'(a)) = \psi(a, i(b_0)) = (a, \snd{\phi}(i(b_0))) = (a, 0) = i_{\be{A}}(a) \]
    and projection maps
    \[ j'(a, e) = a = j_{\be{A}}(a, x) = j_{\be{A}}(\psi(a, e)) \]
    which completes the proof.
\end{myproof}
