\begin{mydefinition}[composition microbundle]{normal::composition}
    Let $\bb$ and $\bc$ be two microbundles over $B$ and $E(\bb)$.
    The \defterm{composition microbundle} $\bb \circ \bc$ is a microbundle
    \[ \bundle{B}{E(\bc)}{i}{j} \]
    where $i := i_\bc \circ i_b$ and $j := j_b \circ j_\bc$.
\end{mydefinition}

% proof
\begin{myproof}[that $\bb \circ \bc$ is a microbundle]
    Both injection and projection are continuous since the are composed by continuous maps.
    Additionally, $j \circ i = j_b \circ (j_\bc \circ i_\bc) \circ i_b = j_b \circ i_b = id_B$.

    It remains to be shown that $\bb \circ \bc$ is locally trivial:

    For an arbitrary $b \in B$, choose local trivializations
    \begin{center}
        $(U_\bb, V_\bb, \phi_b)$ of $b$ and $(U_\bc, V_\bc, \phi_\bc)$ of $j_b(b)$.
    \end{center}
    Since $V_\bb$ and $U_\bc$ are both neighborhoods of $i_b(b)$ in $E(\bb)$, the image
    \[ \phi_b(V_\bb \cap U_\bc) \]
    contains an open set $U \times \ball[\eps]$ where $U$ is open and $\eps$ is sufficiently small.

    With $V := \inv{\phi_\bc}(\inv{\phi_b}(U \times \ball[\eps])) \sub E(\bc)$ and
    \[ U \times \R^n \cong U \times \ball[\eps] \xto{\inv{\phi_\bc} \circ \inv{\phi_b}} V \]
    which is a homeomorphism because its composed by homeomorphisms,
    we constructed a local trivialization of $b$ in $\bc \circ \bb$.
\end{myproof}
