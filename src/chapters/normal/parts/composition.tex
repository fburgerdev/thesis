\begin{mydefinition}[composition microbundle]{normal::composition}
    Let $\bb$ and $\bc$ be two microbundles over $B$ and $E(\bb)$.
    The \defterm{composition microbundle} $\bb \circ \bc$ is a microbundle
    \[ \bundle{B}{E(\bc)}{i}{j} \]
    where $i := i_c \circ i_b$ and $j := j_b \circ j_c$.
\end{mydefinition}

% proof
\begin{myproof}[that $\bb \circ \bc$ is a microbundle]
    Both injection and projection are continuous being composed by continuous maps.
    Additionally, $j \circ i = j_b \circ (j_c \circ i_c) \circ i_b = j_b \circ i_b = id_B$.

    It remains to be shown that $\bb \circ \bc$ is locally trivial.

    For an arbitrary $b \in B$, choose local trivializations
    \begin{center}
        $(U_b, V_b, \phi_b)$ of $b$ and $(U_c, V_c, \phi_c)$ of $j_b(b)$.
    \end{center}
    Since $V_b$ and $U_c$ are both neighborhoods of $i_b(b)$ in $E(\bb)$, the image
    \[ \phi_b(V_b \cap U_c) \]
    contains an open set $U \times \ball[\eps]$ where $U$ is open and $\eps$ is sufficiently small.

    With $V := \inv{\phi_c}(\inv{\phi_b}(U \times \ball[\eps]) \times \R^n) \sub E(\bc)$ and
    \[ \phi: V \xto{\phi_b \circ \frst{\phi_c}} U \times \ball[\eps] \xto{id_U \times \inv{\mu_\eps}} U \times \R^n \]
    we have a homeomorphism because its composed by homeomorphisms.
    % TODO: fix trivialization

    This homeomorphism commutes with injection
    \[ \phi(i(b)) = \]
    and projection maps
    \[.\]
    Hence, $(U, V, \phi)$ is a local trivialization of $b$ in $\bb \circ \bc$.
