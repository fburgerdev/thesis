\begin{mydefinition}[composition microbundle]{normal::composition}
    Let $\ba$ be a $n$-dimensional microbundle with
    \[ \bundledef{\ba}{A}{E(\ba)}{i_a}{j_a} \]
    and let $\bb$ be a $n'$-dimensional microbundle with
    \[ \bundledef{\bb}{E(\ba)}{E(\bb)}{i_b}{j_b}. \]
    The \defterm{composition microbundle} $\ba \circ \bb$ is a $(n + n')$-dimensional microbundle
    \[ \bundle{A}{E(\bb)}{i}{j} \]
    where $i := i_b \circ i_a$ and $j := j_a \circ j_b$.
\end{mydefinition}

% proof
\begin{myproof}[that $\ba \circ \bb$ is a $(n + n')$-dimensional microbundle]
    Both injection and projection maps are continuous being composed by continuous maps.
    Additionally, $j \circ i = j_a \circ (j_b \circ i_b) \circ i_a = j_a \circ i_a = id_A$.

    It remains to be shown that $\ba \circ \bb$ is locally trivial.

    For an arbitrary $a \in A$, choose local trivializations
    \begin{center}
        $(U_a, V_a, \phi_a)$ of $b$ and $(U_b, V_b, \phi_b)$ of $i_a(a)$.
    \end{center}
    Note that both $U_b$ and $V_a$ are open neighborhoods of $i_a(a)$.
    Without loss of generality, the subsets $V_a$ and $U_b$ are equal by
    restricting $U_b$ to $V_a \cap U_b$ and $V_b$ to $\inv{\phi_b}((V_a \cap U_b) \times \R^{n'})$ if necessary.

    We have a local trivialization $(U_a, V_b, \phi)$ of $a$ in $\ba \circ \bb$ where
    \[ 
        \phi: V_b \xto{\phi_b} U_b \times \R^{n'}
        = V_a \times \R^{n'}
        \xto{\phi_a \times id_{\R^{n'}}} U_a \times \R^{n} \times \R^{n'}
        = U_a \times \R^{n + n'}.
    \]
    The map $\phi$ is an homeomorphism, since it's composed by homeomorphisms.

    Additionally, $\phi$ commutes with injection
    \[ \phi(i(a)) = \phi(i_b(i_a(a))) = (\phi_a(i_a(a)), \snd{\phi_b}(i_b(i_a(a)))) \]
    \[ = (\snd{\phi_a}(i_a(a)), 0) = (a, (0, 0)) = (id_{U_a} \times 0)(a) \]
    and projection maps
    \[ j(e) = j_a(j_b(e)) = \pi_1(j_a(j_b(e)), \snd{\phi}(e)) = \pi_1(\phi(e)) \]
    which completes the proof.
