Finally, we gathered all the tools to prove Milnor's theorem.

\theorem{(Milnor)}
For a sufficently large $q \in \N$, $N = N \times \{0\}$ has a normal microbundle in $M \times \R^q$.
% proof
\begin{myproof}
    \begin{enumerate}
        % statement
        \item There exists a microbundle $\bt'$ over $N$ such that $\bt_N \oplus \bt' \cong \be[q]_n$:
        
        % proof
        From the \extref{Whitney Embedding Thereom} it follows that we can embed $N$ in euclidean space $\R^{2m + 1}$.
        Additionally, from previous conseriderations we can extend $\bt_N$ to a microbundle over an open neighborhood $V \sub \R^{2m + 1}$.
        Now we can apply the \intref{Whitney trivialization Theorem} from Chapter 4.

        % statement
        \item $E(\rtn) \sub E(\whitney)$ has a normal microbundle:

        %proof
        Consider $\bundledef{j^*(\whitney)}{E(\rtn)}{E(\whitney)}{i'}{j'}$ where $j$ is the projection map for $\rtn$.
        Since $i'$ is injective, we can consider $E(\rtn) \sub E(\whitney)$.
        Since total spaces of microbundles over manifolds are manifolds as well, it follows that $j^*(\whitney)$ is a normal microbundle.
    \end{enumerate}
    Since $N \sub M \sub E(\rtn)$ has a normal microbundle (\intref{previous lemma}) it follows from \intref{transitivity} that $N \sub E(r^*\bt_N \oplus r^*\bt')$ has a normal microbundle.
    But $r^*\bt_N \oplus r^*\bt'$ is trivial and therefore w.l.o.g. $E(\whitney) \cong N \times \R^q$
\end{myproof}
