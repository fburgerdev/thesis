% definition
\begin{mydefinition}
    Again, let $M$ and $N$ be two topological manifolds with $N \sub M$.
    We say that $N$ has a \defterm{product neighborhood} in $M$ if
    there exists a trivial normal microbundle of $N$ in $M$.
\end{mydefinition}

% lemma
\begin{mylemma}
    A submanifold $N \sub M$ has a product neighborhood if and only if
    there exists a neighborhood $U$ of $N$ with $(U, M) \cong (M \times R^n, \cyldown{M})$.
\end{mylemma}

% proof
\begin{myproof}
    This follows directly from the definition of normal microbundles and the criteria for trivial microbundles.
\end{myproof}
