% definition
\definition{\parttitle{product neighborhood}} \\
Again, let $M$ and $N$ be two topological manifolds with $N \sub M$.
We say that $N$ has a \defterm{product neighborhood} in $M$ if
there exists a trivial normal microbundle of $N$ in $M$.

% statement
\lemma{\parttitle{criteria for product neighborhoods}} \\
A submanifold $N \sub M$ has a product neighborhood if and only if there exists a neighborhood $U$ of $N$ with $(U, M) \cong (M \times R^n, M \times 0)$.
% proof
\begin{myproof}
This follows directly from the definition of normal microbundles and the criteria for trivial microbundles.
