\begin{mydefinition}{whitney::definition}
    Let $\bb_1$ and $\bb_1$ be two microbundles over $B$ with fibre-dimensions $n_1$ and $n_2$.
    The \defterm{whitney sum} $\wsum{\bb_1}{\bb_2}$ is a microbundle $\bundle{B}{E}{i}{j}$ where
    \begin{itemize}
        \item $E := \{ (e_1, e_2) \in E(\bb_1) \times E(\bb_2) \mid j_1(e_1) = j_2(e_2)\}$
        \item $i(b) := (i_1(b), i_2(b))$
        \item $j(e_1, e_2) := j_1(e_1) = j_2(e_2)$
    \end{itemize}
    with fibre-dimension $n_1 + n_2$.
\end{mydefinition}
% proof
\begin{myproof}[that $\bb_1 \oplus \bb_2$ is a microbundle]
    For an arbitray $b \in B$, let $(U_1, V_1, \phi_1)$ and $(U_2, V_2, \phi_2)$ be two local trivializations of $b$ in $\bb_1$ and $\bb_2$.
    We construct a local trivialization of $b$ in $\bb_1 \oplus \bb_2$ as follows:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item $U := U_1 \cap U_2$
        \item $V := (V_1 \times V_2) \cap E$
        \item $\phi: V \to U \times \R^{n_1 + n_2}; \phi(e_1, e_2) := (\phi_1^{(1)}(e_1), \phi_1^{(2)}(e_1) \times  \phi_2^{(2)}(e_2))$
    \end{itemize}
    Note that $\phi_1^{(1)}(e_1) = \phi_2^{(1)}(e_2)$.
    Both $U$ and $V$ are open since $U_1, U_2$ and $V_1, V_2$ are open.
    Since $\phi$ is a composed by homeomorphisms, it's an homeomorphism as well.
    This conludes the proof that $\bb_1 \oplus \bb_2$ is a microbundle (of fibre-dimension $n_1 + n_2$).
\end{myproof}

\begin{myremark}{whitney::alternative}
    Alternatively, we could define the whitney sum between $\bb_1$ and $\bb_2$ to be the induced microbundle $\Delta^*(\bb_1 \times \bb_2)$
    where $\Delta$ denotes the diagonal map and $\bb_1 \times \bb_2$ denotes the literal cross-product between the two microbundles.
