% lemma
\begin{mylemma}{whitney::compatibility}
    Let $\bb_1$ and $\bb_1$ be two microbundles over $B$ and let $f: A \to B$ be a map.
    The induced microbundle and the whitney sum are compatible, that is
    \[ \ind{f}(\whitney{\bb_1}{\bb_2}) \cong \whitney{\ind{f}\bb_1}{\ind{f}\bb_2}. \]
\end{mylemma}

% proof
\begin{myproof}
    From the definition of the induced microbundle and the whitney sum, we can explicitly write the total spaces
    \[ E(\ind{f}(\whitney{\bb_1}{\bb_2})) \]
    \[ = \{(a, (e_1, e_2)) \in A \times (E(\bb_1) \times E(\bb_2)) \mid j_1(e_1) = j_2(e_2) = f(a) \} \]
    and
    \[ E(\whitney{\ind{f}\bb_1}{\ind{f}\bb_2}) \]
    \[ = \{(e_1, e_2) \in E(\ind{f}\bb_1) \times E(\ind{f}\bb_2) \mid j_1(e_1) = j(e_2)\}\]
    \[ = \{((a_1, e_1), (a_2, e_2)) \in (A \times E(\bb_1)) \times (A \times E(\bb_2)) \mid \]
    \[ j(a_1, e_1) = j(a_2, e_2) \land f(a_i) = j(e_i)\} \]
    The two total spaces are homeomorphic via $\phi(a, (e_1, e_2)) := ((a, e_1), (a, e_2))$ with $\inv{\phi}((a, e_1), (a, e_2)) = (a, (e_1, e_2))$.
    Homeomorphy of $\phi$ follows from the continuity of $\phi$ and $\inv{\phi}$, which is given since both $\phi$ and $\inv{\phi}$ are composed by identity maps.
    
    It remains to be shown that injection and projection maps $i$ and $j$ for $E(\ind{f}(\whitney{\bb_1}{\bb_2}))$
    and $i'$ and $j'$ for $\whitney{\ind{f}\bb_1}{\ind{f}\bb_2}$ agree under $\phi$.

    This follows from
    \[ \phi(i(a)) = \phi(a, i_1(f(a)), i_2(f(a))) \]
    \[ = ((a, i_1(f(a))), (a, i_2(f(a)))) = (i_1'(a), i_2'(a)) = i'(a) \]
    and
    \[ j(a, e_1, e_2) = a = j'((a, e_1), (a, e_2)) = j'(\phi(a, e_1, e_2)). \]
