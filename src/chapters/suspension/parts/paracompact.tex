% lemma
\begin{mylemma}{suspension::paracompact}
    Let $\bb$ be a rooted microbundle over a paracompact space $B$ with rooting $R$.
    Then there exists a closed neighborhood $W$ of $b_0$ and an isomorphism-germ
    \[ \germ{\bb\restr{W}}{\be_W} \]
    extending $R$ together with a map $\lambda: B \to [0, 1]$ with
    \[ \supp{\lambda} \sub W \tand \lambda(b_0) = 1. \]
\end{mylemma}

% proof
\begin{myproof}
    Let $r: W_r \to b_0 \times \R^n$ be a representative map for $R$.
    Consider a local trivialization $(U, V, \phi)$ for $b_0$ such that $V \cap E(\bbb) \sub W_r$.
    % TODO: Why does such a trivialization exist?
    With
    \[ \psi: V \isomto \psi(V) \sub U \times \R^n \]
    \[ \psi(e) = (j(e), r(\inv{\phi}(b_0, \snd{\phi}(e)))) \]
    we have a representative for an isomorphism-germ $\germ{\bb\restr{U}}{\be_U}$ extending $R$.
    Consider the open covering of $B$ with $U$ and $B$ itself.
    Since $B$ is paracompact, we can apply the concept of partition of unity and have therefore a map
    \[ \lambda: B \to [0, 1] \]
    with 
    \[ \supp\lambda \sub U \tand \lambda(b_0) = 1. \]
    Now we can choose $W := \supp\lambda$, which is closed by definition of $\supp$.
    By restricting the constructed isomorphism-germ over $U$ to $W$, we have an isomorphism-germ $\germ{\bb\restr{W}}{\be_W}$.
    Together with $\lambda$, this concludes our proof.
