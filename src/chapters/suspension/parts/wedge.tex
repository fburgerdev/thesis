% definition wedge sum
\begin{mydefinition}{suspension::wedge}
    Let $\ba$ and $\bb$ be two rooted microbundles over $A$ and $B$.
    % microbundle
    The \defterm{wedge sum} $\ba \vee \bb$ of $\ba$ and $\bb$ is microbundle over $A \vee B$
    \[ \ba \vee \bb \xto{i_\ba \vee i_\bb} E(\ba \vee \bb) \xto{j_\ba \vee j_\bb} A \vee B \]
    where the total space is
    \[ (E(\ba) \sqcup E(\bb)) / (f(e_a) \sim e_b) \]
    and $f: E(\ba\restr{a_0}) \bus W_a \isomto W_b \sub E(\bb\restr{b_0})$ is some representative for $R_b^{-1} \circ R_a$.
    % rooting
    We equip $\ba \vee \bb$ with a rooting
    \[ R: E((\ba \vee \bb)\restr{a_0}) \double \be_{a_0} \]
    represented by any representative for $R_a$ (or $R_b$).
\end{mydefinition}
% proof wedge sum
\begin{myproof}[that $\ba \vee \bb$ is a microbundle]
    We show that $\ba \vee \bb$ is a microbundle and afterwards show
    that the definition of $\ba \vee \bb$ is independant of the choice of the representative $f$ for $R_b^{-1} \circ R_a$.
    \begin{enumerate}
        % microbundle
        \item $\ba \vee \bb$ is a microbundle:
        \begin{itemize}
            % injection
            \item The injection map $i_\ba \vee i_\bb$ is well-defined because 
            \[ i(a_0) = i_\ba(a_0) = f(i_\ba(a_0)) = i_\bb(b_0) = i(b_0) \]
            and continuous since $i_\ba$ and $i_\bb$ are continuous.
            % projection
            \item The projection map $j_\ba \vee j_\bb$ is well-defined because
            \[ \forall e \in V_a: j(e) = j_\ba(e) = a_0 = b_0 = j_\bb(f(e)) = j(f(e)) \]
            and continuous since $j_\ba$ and $j_\bb$ are continuous.
            % compatibility
            \item The composition $j \circ i = id_{A \vee B}$ because for every $a \in A$
            \[ j(i(a)) = j(i_\ba(a)) = j_\ba(i_\ba(a)) = a \]
            since $j_\ba \circ i_\ba = id_A$ (analogous for $B$).
        \end{itemize}
        % local triviality
        It remains to show local triviality.

        The subspace topology of $E(\ba\restr{a_0})$ yields an open subset $W_a' \sub E(\ba)$ with $W_a = W_a' \cap E(\ba\restr{a_0})$.
        Symmetrically, let $W_b' \sub E(\bb)$ with $W_b = W_b' \cap E(\bb\restr{b_0})$.

        Let $x \in A \vee B$, w.l.o.g. $x \in A$ for symmetry reasons.
        \begin{itemize}
            % trivial case
            \item $x \neq a_0$:
            
            Choose a local trivialization $(U, V, \phi)$ for $x$ in $\ba$.
            We can assume $U \cap B = \emptyset$ by subtracting $U$ by $\{a_0\}$ which is closed since $A$ is hausdorff.
            Now we can simply use this trivialization for $\ba \vee \bb$ since $U$ is open in $A \vee B$, $V$ is open in $E(\ba \vee \bb)$ and $V \cong U \times \R^n$.
            % special case
            \item $x = a_0$:
            
            Choose local trivializations $(U_a, V_a, \phi_a)$ for $a_0$ in $\ba$ and $(U_b, V_b, \phi_b)$ for $b_0$ in $\bb$.
            \begin{itemize}
                \item We can assume $V_b \cap j^{-1}(b_0) \sub W_b$ by choosing a local trivialization for $b_0$ in
                the microbundle over the restricted total space $(E(\bb) - j_\bb^{-1}(b_0)) \cup W_a$ (\intref{microbundle::totalspace}).
                \item We can assume $V_a \cap j^{-1}(a_0) \sub V_b \cap j^{-1}(b_0)$ by choosing a local trivialization for $a_0$ in
                the microbundle over the restricted total space $(E(\ba) - j_\ba^{-1}(b_0)) \cup (V_b \cap j^{-1}(b_0))$.
            \end{itemize}
            The subset $X_b := \phi_b^{(2)}f(V_a \cap j^{-1}(a_0))$ is homeomorphic to $\R^n$ via
            \[ a_0 \times \R^n \xto{\phi^{-1}} V_a \cap j^{-1}(a_0) \xto{f} X_b \]
            and open since $f$ and $\phi$ are homeomorphisms.
            By choosing $V_b' := \phi_b^{-1}(B \times X_b)$ and $\phi_b'(e) := (j(e), \phi_a^{(2)}(f^{-1}(\phi_b^{(2)}(e))))$,
            we have local trivializations $(U_a, V_a, \phi_a)$ and $(U_b, V_b', \phi_b')$ that agree on $W_a = W_b$.
            This yields a local trivialization for $\ba \vee \bb$.
        \end{itemize}
        % well-defined
        \item $\ba \vee \bb$ is independant of the choice of $f$:
        Let $f'$ be another representative for $R_b^{-1} \circ R_a$ and $(\ba \vee \bb)'$ the resulting wedge sum.
        Choose an open neighborhood $V \sub E(\ba\restr{a_0})$ of $i_\ba(a)$ where $f$ and $f'$ agree.
        By subtracting $j_\ba^{-1}(a_0) - V$ from $E(\ba \vee \bb)$ and $E(\ba \vee \bb)'$ the microbundles remain unchanged.
        However, now the total spaces are equal and injection and projection are the same.

    \end{enumerate}
