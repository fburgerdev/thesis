% hausdorff
\begin{myparagraph}
    The following definition requires the base spaces to be hausdorff.
    This is useful because this implies that the singleton containing only the base point is closed,
    and can therefore be removed from any open set without losing openness.  
\end{myparagraph}

% definition
\begin{mydefinition}{suspension::wedge}
    Let $\ba$ and $\bb$ be two rooted microbundles over $A$ and $B$.
    % microbundle
    The \defterm{wedge sum} $\ba \vee \bb$ of $\ba$ and $\bb$ is a microbundle over $A \vee B$
    \[ \ba \vee \bb \xto{i_\ba \vee i_\bb} E(\ba \vee \bb) \xto{j_\ba \vee j_\bb} A \vee B \]
    where the total space is
    \[ (E(\ba) \sqcup E(\bb)) / (f(e_a) \sim e_a) \]
    and $f: E(\ba\restr{a_0}) \bus W_a \isomto W_b \sub E(\bb\restr{b_0})$ is some representative for $\inv{R_b} \circ R_a$.
    % rooting
    We equip $\ba \vee \bb$ with a rooting
    \[ \germdef{R}{E((\ba \vee \bb)\restr{a_0})}{\be_{a_0}} \]
    represented by any representative for $R_a$ (or $R_b$).
\end{mydefinition}

% proof
\begin{myproof}[that $\ba \vee \bb$ is a microbundle]
    We show that $\ba \vee \bb$ is a microbundle and afterwards show
    that the definition of $\ba \vee \bb$ is independant of the choice of the representative $f$ for $\inv{R_b} \circ R_a$.
    \begin{enumerate}
        % microbundle
        \item $\ba \vee \bb$ is a microbundle:
        \begin{itemize}
            % injection
            \item The injection map $i_\ba \vee i_\bb$ is well-defined because 
            \[ i(a_0) = i_\ba(a_0) = f(i_\ba(a_0)) = i_\bb(b_0) = i(b_0) \]
            and continuous since $i_\ba$ and $i_\bb$ are continuous.
            % projection
            \item The projection map $j_\ba \vee j_\bb$ is well-defined because
            \[ \forall e \in W_a: j(e) = j_\ba(e) = a_0 = b_0 = j_\bb(f(e)) = j(f(e)) \]
            and continuous since $j_\ba$ and $j_\bb$ are continuous.
            % compatibility
            \item The composition $j \circ i = id_{A \vee B}$ because for every $a \in A$
            \[ j(i(a)) = j(i_\ba(a)) = j_\ba(i_\ba(a)) = a \]
            since $j_\ba \circ i_\ba = id_A$ (analogous for $B$).
        \end{itemize}
        % local triviality
        It remains to show local triviality.

        The subspace topology of $E(\ba\restr{a_0})$ yields an open subset $W_a' \sub E(\ba)$ with $W_a = W_a' \cap E(\ba\restr{a_0})$.
        Symmetrically, let $W_b' \sub E(\bb)$ with $W_b = W_b' \cap E(\bb\restr{b_0})$.

        Let $x \in A \vee B$, w.l.o.g. $x \in A$ for symmetry reasons.
        \begin{itemize}
            % trivial case
            \item $x \neq a_0$:
            
            Choose a local trivialization $(U, V, \phi)$ for $x$ in $\ba$.
            We can assume $U \cap B = \emptyset$ by subtracting $U$ by $\{a_0\}$ which is closed since $A$ is hausdorff.
            Now we can simply use this trivialization for $\ba \vee \bb$
            since $U$ is open in $A \vee B$, $V$ is open in $E(\ba \vee \bb)$ and $V \cong U \times \R^n$.
            % special case
            \item $x = a_0$:
            
            Choose local trivializations $(U_a, V_a, \phi_a)$ for $a_0$ in $\ba$ and $(U_b, V_b, \phi_b)$ for $b_0$ in $\bb$.
            \begin{itemize}
                \item We can assume $V_b \cap E(\bbb) \sub W_b$ by choosing a local trivialization for $b_0$ in
                the microbundle over the restricted total space
                $(E(\bb) - E(\bbb)) \cup W_a$ (the existence is justified by \intref{microbundle::total}).
                \item We can assume $V_a \cap E(\bab) \sub W_b \cap E(\bbb)$ by choosing a local trivialization for $a_0$ in
                the microbundle over the restricted total space $(E(\ba) - E(\bbb)) \cup (V_b \cap E(\bbb))$.
            \end{itemize}
            The subset $X_b := \snd{\phi_b}f(V_a \cap E(\bab)) \sub W_b \cap E(\bbb)$ is homeomorphic to $\R^n$ via
            \[ a_0 \times \R^n \xto{\inv{\phi}} V_a \cap E(\bab) \xto{f} X_b \]
            and open since $f$ and $\phi$ are homeomorphisms.
            By choosing $V_b' := \inv{\phi_b}(B \times X_b)$ and $\phi_b'(e) := (j(e), \snd{\phi_a}(\inv{f}(\snd{\phi_b}(e))))$,
            we have local trivializations $(U_a, V_a, \phi_a)$ and $(U_b, V_b', \phi_b')$ that agree on $W_a = W_b$.
            This yields a local trivialization for $\ba \vee \bb$.
        \end{itemize}
        % well-defined
        \item The wedge sum $\ba \vee \bb$ is independant of the choice of $f$:

        Let $f'$ be another representative for $\inv{R_b} \circ R_a$ and $(\ba \vee \bb)'$ the resulting wedge sum.
        We need to find an isomorphism germ that extends $\inv{R'} \circ R = \inv{R} \circ R = id$.
        Choose an open neighborhood $V \sub E(\ba\restr{a_0})$ of $i_\ba(a)$ where $f$ and $f'$ agree.
        By subtracting $\inv{j_\ba}(a_0) - V$ from $E(\ba \vee \bb)$ and $E(\ba \vee \bb)'$ the microbundles remain unchanged.
        This is because the resulting subspaces are open since $\inv{j_\ba}(a_0)$ is closed (hausdorff) and $V$ is open.
        So the total spaces are equal and injection and projection maps are defined the same.
        Using the modified total spaces, it follows that the identity $\germ{(\ba \vee \bb)}{(\ba \vee \bb)'}$ is an isomorphism-germ.
        This surely extends $\inv{R'} \circ R$, which concludes the proof.
    \end{enumerate}
\end{myproof}
