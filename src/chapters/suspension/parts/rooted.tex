    % rooted
    A \defterm{rooted microbundle} $\bb$ over $B$ is a microbundle
    over $B$ together with an isomorphism-germ
    \[ \germdef{R}{\bbb}{\be{b_0}}. \]
    % isomorphy
    Two rooted microbundles $\bb$ and $\bb'$ are \defterm{rooted-isomorphic}
    if there exists an isomorphism-germ $\germ{\bb}{\bb'}$ extending
    \[ \germdef{\inv{R'} \circ R}{\bbb}{\bbb'}. \]
\end{mydefinition}

% afterword
\begin{myparagraph}
    Having a rooting is necessary
    so that the `wedge-sum' of two microbundles is well-defined
    that we will see later in this chapter.
