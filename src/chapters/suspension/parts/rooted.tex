In this chapter, let $B$ be a topological space and $b_0 \in B$ be an arbitray base point.
\begin{mydefinition}
    A \defterm{rooted microbundle} $\bb_*$ over $B$ is a microbundle $\bb$ over $B$ together with an isomorphism-germ
    \[ R: \bb\restr{b_0} \double \be^n_{b_0}. \]

    Two rooted microbundles $\bb_*$ and $\bb'_*$ are \defterm{isomorphic} if there exists an isomorphism germ $\bb \double \bb'$ extending
    \[ R'^{-1} \circ R: \bb\restr{b_0} \double \bb'\restr{b_0} \]
\end{mydefinition}

% \begin{myparagraph}
%     In the following, let $B$ be hausdorff.
%     Demanding this allows us to assume the rooting $R$ of a rooted microbundle over $B$ to have a representative of the form
%     \[ f: E(\bb_*\restr{b_0}) \isomto b_0 \times \R^n. \]
%     Such a representative can be constructed by any representative $f': E(\bb_*\restr{b_0}) \bus V \to b_0 \times \R^n$
%     by restricting $f'$ to $f'^{-1}(b_0 \times \ball[\varepsilon])$ for a sufficiently small $\varepsilon > 0$ and
%     composing with a homemorphism $\ball[\varepsilon] \isomto \R^n$ that is the identity for a neighborhood of $0$.
%     Now, w.l.o.g. we can assume that $V = E(\bb_*\restr{b_0})$ because we can restrict the total space $E(\bb_*)$
%     to $(E(\bb_*) - j^{-1}(b_0)) \cup V'$ where $V' \sub E(\bb_*)$ is open with $V = V' \cap j^{-1}(b_0)$.
%     Note that the resulting subspace is open since $j^{-1}(b_0)$ is closed due to the assumption that $B$ is hausdorff.
