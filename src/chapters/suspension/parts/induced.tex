\begin{mystatement}{definition}{suspension::induced}
    Let $\bb$ be a rooted microbundle over $B$ and $f: A \to B$ a based map.
    The \defterm{induced microbundle} of $f$ over $\bb$
    is the initial induced microbundle $\ind{f}\bb$ together with the rooting
    \[
        \germdef{\ind{f}R}{E(\ind{f}\bb[a_0])
        = a_0 \cross E(\bb[b_0])}{e^n_{a_0}}
    \]
    that coincides with $R$ if we consider
    $a_0 \cross E(\bb[b_0]) = E(\bb[b_0])$ and $e^n_{a_0} = e^n_{b_0}$.
\end{mystatement}

% afterword
\begin{myparagraph}
    Note that the total space $E(\ind{f}\bb[a_0])$ equals $a_0 \cross E(\bbb)$ because
    \[
        E(\ind{f}\bb[a_0])
        = \set{(a, e) \in A \cross E(\bb)}{a = a_0 \land f(a) = b_0 = j(e)}
    \]
    \[
        = a_0 \cross \set{e \in E(\bb)}{j(e) = b_0}
        = a_0 \cross E(\bbb).
    \]
