\begin{mylemma}{suspension::commutativity}
    The rooted microbundles $\whitney{\bb}{\be_B}$ and $\whitney{\be_B}{\bb}$ are rooted-isomorphic. 
\end{mylemma}

% proof
\begin{myproof}
    We need to find an isomorphism germ
    $\germ{\whitney{\bb}{\be_B}}{\whitney{\be_B}{\bb}}$ that extends
    \[ (\whitney{I}{R}) \circ \inv{(\whitney{R}{I})} = \whitney{R}{\inv{R}} \]
    where $I$ denotes the identity germ.

    Ignoring the rooting, we have an
    isomorphism-germ $f: E(\bb) \times \R^n \isomto \R^n \times E(\bb)$ with $f(e, x) = (-x, e)$.
    The idea is to change to $f$ near $b_0$ so that it extends the rooting.

    Using the previous lemma, choose a sufficiently small closed neighborhood $U$ of $b_0$
    such that there exists an extension $\germdef{Q}{(\whitney{\bb}{\be})\restr{U}}{(\whitney{\be}{\bb})\restr{U}}$ for the rooting.

    Since $B$ is Tychonoff, there exists a map
    \[ \lambda: B \to [0, \frac{\pi}{2}] \]
    with $\supp \lambda \sub U$ and $\lambda(b_0) = \frac{\pi}{2}$.
    With this map, we can define a homeomorphism
    \[ g: U \times \R^n \times \R^n \isomto U \times \R^n \times \R^n \]
    by
    \[ g(b, x, y) = (b, x \sin(\lambda(b)) - y \cos(\lambda(b)), x \cos(\lambda(b)) - y \sin(\lambda(b))). \]

    Now, we can consider
    \[ \germ{(\whitney{\bb}{\be})\restr{U}}{(\whitney{\bb}{\be})\restr{U}} \xto{g} \germ{(\whitney{\bb}{\be})\restr{U}}{(\whitney{\be}{\bb})\restr{U}} \]
    which coincides with $\whitney{R}{\inv{R}}$ over $b_0$
    since $g(b_0, x, y) = (b_0, x, y)$ and with $F$ over $U \cap \inv{\lambda}(0)$.
    Pieced together with $F\restr{\inv{\lambda}(b)}$,
    we have an isomorphism germ $\germ{\whitney{\bb}{\be_B}}{\whitney{\be_B}{\bb}}$
    that extends the rooting, which completes the proof.
