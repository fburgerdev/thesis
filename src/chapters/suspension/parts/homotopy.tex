Let $\bb'_*$ be a rooted microbundle over $B'$.
\begin{mytheorem}\label{suspension::homotopy}%
    Let $f, g: B \to B'$ be two homotopic maps together with a homotopy $H: B \times [0, 1] \to B'$
    that leaves base points fixed.
    Then the rooted microbundles $f^*\bb'_*$ and $g^*\bb'_*$ are isomorphic.
\end{mytheorem}

% foreword lemma
\begin{myparagraph}
    Let $\bb'_*$ be a rooted microbundle over $B'$ and $f: B \times [0, 1] \to B'$ a map. 
    First, note that the total space
    \[ E(f^*\bb_*\restr{b_0 \times [0, 1]}) \]
    is just
    \[ \{ e \in E(f^*\bb_*) \mid j(e) \in b_0 \times [0, 1] \} \]
    \[ = \{ (b, t, e) \in B \times [0, 1] \times E(\bb_*) \mid b = b_0, f(b, t) = j(e) \} \]
    \[ = b_0 \times [0, 1] \times E(\bb_*\restr{b_0'}). \]
    Based on this, we can define an isomorphism-germ
    \[ \bar{R}: f^*\bb_*\restr{b_0 \times [0, 1]} \double \be^n_{b_0 \times [0, 1]} \]
    via a representative
    \[ \bar{r}: b_0 \times [0, 1] \times V \to b_0 \times [0, 1] \times \R^n \]
    with
    \[ \bar{r}(b_0, t, v) = (b_0, t, r(v) )\]
    where $r: V \to E(\be^n_{b_0})$ is a representative for $R$.
    The representative $\bar{r}$ is a homoemorphism on its image
    because its a product of the identity and $r$, which are both homoemorphisms on their image. 
\end{myparagraph}
% lemma
\begin{mylemma}
    Let $\bb'_*$ be a rooted microbundle over $B'$ and $f: B \times [0, 1] \to B'$ be a map.
    Then there exists a neighborhood $V$ of $b_0$ with an isomorphism-germ
    \[ f^*\bb_*\restr{V \times [0, 1]} \double \be^n_{V \times [0, 1]} \]
    extending $\bar{R}$, defined like above.
\end{mylemma}
\begin{myproof}
    By applying \intref{homotopy::lemma2}, it follows that there exists an isomorphism-germ
    \[ Q: f^*\bb_*\restr{V \times [0, 1]} \double \be^n_{V \times [0, 1]} \]
    for a sufficiently small neighborhood $V$ of $b_0$.

    Now consider
    \[ Q \circ \bar{R}^{-1}: \be^n_{b_0 \times [0, 1]} \double \be^n_{b_0 \times [0, 1]}. \]
    Similarly to the construction of $\bar{R}$ we can define an isomorphism-germ
    \[ P: \be^n_{V \times [0, 1]} \double \be^n_{V \times [0, 1]} \]
    extending $Q \circ \bar{R}^{-1}$ via
    \[ p(v, t, x) = (v, q(b_0, t, x)) \]
    where $q$ is a representative for $Q \circ \bar{R}^{-1}$.

    Restricted to $b_0 \times [0, 1]$, $P$ agrees with $Q \times \bar{R}^{-1}$ and thus
    \[ P^{-1} \circ Q = (\bar{R} \circ Q^{-1}) \circ Q = \bar{R} \]
    Since $P$ and $Q$ are both isomorphism-germs, $P^{-1} \circ Q$ is an isomorphism-germ as well.
    Therefore, $P^{-1} \circ Q$ suffices our requirements which concludes the proof.
\end{myproof}
