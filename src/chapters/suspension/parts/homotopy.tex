% rooted homotopy theorem
\begin{mytheorem}\label{suspension::homotopy}%
    Let $\bb$ be a rooted microbundle over $B$ and $f, g: A \to B$ be two based maps.
    If there exists a homotopy $H: A \times \I \to B$ between $f$ and $g$ that leaves the base point fixed,
    then the two rooted microbundles $f^*\bb$ and $g^*\bb$ are isomorphic.
\end{mytheorem}

% foreword lemma
\begin{myparagraph}
    We need to show a rooted version of \intref{homotopy::lemma2}.
    Before we prove the lemma, note that 
    \[ E(H^*\bb\restr{a_0 \times \I}) \]
    is just
    \[ \{ e \in E(H^*\bb) \mid j(e) \in a_0 \times \I \} \]
    \[ = \{ (a, t, e) \in A \times \I \times E(\bb) \mid a = a_0 \land H(a, t) = j(e) \} \]
    \[ = a_0 \times \I \times E(\bbb). \]
    Based on this, we can define an isomorphism-germ
    \[ \germdef{\bar{R}}{H^*\bb\restr{a_0 \times \I}}{\be_{a_0 \times \I}} \]
    via a representative
    \[ \bar{r}: a_0 \times \I \times V \to a_0 \times \I \times \R^n \]
    with
    \[ \bar{r}(a_0, t, v) = (a_0, t, r(v) )\]
    where $r: V \to E(\be_{b_0})$ is a representative for $R$.
    The representative $\bar{r}$ is a homoemorphism on its image
    because it is a product of the identity and $r$, which are both homoemorphisms on their image. 
\end{myparagraph}
% lemma
\begin{mylemma}
    Let $\bb$ be a rooted microbundle over $B$ and let $H: A \times \I \to B$ be a map that leaves the base point fixed.
    There exists a neighborhood $V$ of $a_0$ with an isomorphism-germ
    \[ \germ{H^*\bb\restr{V \times \I}}{\be_{V \times \I}} \]
    extending $\bar{R}$ (as defined above).
\end{mylemma}
\begin{myproof}
    By applying \intref{homotopy::lemma2}, it follows that there exists an isomorphism-germ
    \[ \germdef{Q}{H^*\bb\restr{V \times \I}}{\be_{V \times \I}} \]
    for a sufficiently small neighborhood $V$ of $b_0$.

    Now consider
    \[ \germdef{Q \circ \bar{R}^{-1}}{\be_{b_0 \times \I}}{\double \be_{b_0 \times \I}}. \]
    Similarly to the construction of $\bar{R}$ we can define an isomorphism-germ
    \[ \germdef{P}{\be_{V \times \I}}{\be_{V \times \I}} \]
    extending $Q \circ \bar{R}^{-1}$ via
    \[ p(v, t, x) = (v, q(b_0, t, x)) \]
    where $q$ is a representative for $Q \circ \bar{R}^{-1}$.

    Restricted to $b_0 \times \I$, $P$ agrees with $Q \times \bar{R}^{-1}$ and thus
    \[ P^{-1} \circ Q = (\bar{R} \circ Q^{-1}) \circ Q = \bar{R} \]
    Since $P$ and $Q$ are both isomorphism-germs, $P^{-1} \circ Q$ is an isomorphism-germ as well.
    Therefore, $P^{-1} \circ Q$ suffices our requirements which concludes the proof.
\end{myproof}
