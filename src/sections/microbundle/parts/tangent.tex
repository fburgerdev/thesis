% definition
\begin{mystatement}{definition}[tangent microbundle]{microbundle::tangent}[55]
    The \defterm{tangent microbundle} $\bt_M$ over
    a topological $d$-manifold $M$ is a manifold
    \[ \bundle{M}{M \cross M}{\Delta}{\pi_1} \]
    where $\Delta(m) = (m, m)$ denotes the diagonal map.
\end{mystatement}

% proof
\begin{myproof}[that $\bt_M$ is a microbundle]
    % continuity and compatibility
    The maps $\Delta$ and $\pi_1$ are continuous and clearly $\pi_1 \circ \Delta = id_M$.

    % local triviality
    % local triviality :: homeomorphism
    For an arbitrary $p \in M$,
    choose a chart $(U, \varphi)$ over $p$.
    We have a local trivialization $(U, U \cross U, \phi)$ of $p$ in $\bt_M$ given by
    \[ \phi: U \cross U \isomto U \cross \R^n \twith \phi(u, u') = (u, \varphi(u) - \varphi(u')). \]
    Since $\psi$ is a homeomorphism, $\phi$ is a homeomorphism as well.
    
    % local triviality :: commutativity
    Commutativity with $i$ and $id \times 0$ is given by
    \[ \phi(\Delta(m)) = \phi(m, m) = (m, \varphi(m) - \varphi(m)) = (m, 0) = (id \cross 0)(m)\]
    and with $\pi_1$ by
    \[ \pi_1(u, u') = u = \pi_1(u, \snd{\phi}(u, u')) = \pi_1(\phi(u, u')). \]
    Note that $\snd{\phi}$ denotes $\pi_2 \circ \phi$.
\end{myproof}

% remark
\begin{mystatement}{remark}{microbundle::tangentdim}
    The tangent microbundle $\bt_M$ has fiber dimension $d$.
