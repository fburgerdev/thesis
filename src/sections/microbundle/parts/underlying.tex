\begin{mystatement}{example}[underlying microbundle]{microbundle::underlying}
    Let $\xi: E \xto{\pi} B$ be a $n$-dimensional vector bundle.
    The \defterm{underlying microbundle} $\abs{\xi}$ of $\xi$ is a microbundle
    \[ \bundledef{\abs{\xi}}{B}{E}{i}{\pi} \]
    where $i: B \to E$ denotes the \defterm{zero-cross section} of $\xi$, that is
    the section that maps every $b \in B$ to the neutral element $0_b$
    of its fiber $\inv{\pi}(b) \cong \R^n$.
\end{mystatement}

% proof
\begin{myproof}[that $\abs{\xi}$ is a microbundle]
    % open
    First, note that $\pi$ is an open map:

    Let $V \sub E$ be open.
    For every $b \in \pi(V)$, there exists a neighborhood $U_b$
    together with a homeomorphism $\phi_b: \inv{\pi}(U_b) \isomto U_b \times \R^n$.
    It follows that $\pi\restr{\inv{\pi}(U_b)} = \pi_1 \circ \phi_b$.
    Hence, $\pi\restr{\inv{\pi}(U_b)}$ is open due to openness of $\pi_1$ and $\phi_b$.

    We conclude from
    \[ \pi(V) = \bigcup_{b \in B} \pi\restr{\inv{\pi}(U_b)}(V) \]
    that $\pi$ is open.

    % continuity and compatibility
    Now from $\inv{i}(V) = \pi(V)$ it follows that $i$ is continuous.
    Additionally, $\pi \circ i = id_B$ since $\pi(i(b)) = \pi(0_b) = b$. 

    % local triviality
    Local triviality and commutativity with $id \cross 0$ and $\pi_1$
    are immediatly inherited from the local triviality conditions for vector bundles.
\end{myproof}
