\begin{myparagraph}
    The following statement is fundamental for the theory of microbundles.
    It justifies that the tangent microbundle
    is a generalization of the tangent vector bundle.

% theorem
\begin{mystatement}{theorem}{microbundle::equivalence}
    Let $M$ be a smooth $d$-manifold.
    Then the underlying microbundle of $\xi: TM \to M$ and the tangent microbundle $\bt_M$
    are isomorphic.
