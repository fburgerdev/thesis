\begin{myparagraph}
    The following statement is fundamental for the theory of microbundles.
    It justifies that the tangent microbundle can be considered
    as a generalization of the tangent vector bundle.
\end{myparagraph}

% theorem
\begin{mystatement}{theorem}{microbundle::equivalence}[56]
    Let $M$ be a smooth $d$-manifold.
    Then the underlying microbundle of $\xi: TM \to M$ and the tangent microbundle $\bt_M$
    are isomorphic. 
\end{mystatement}

% proof
\begin{myproof}
    We equip $M$ with a Riemannian metric,
    which allows us to define the usual 
    exponential map $\exp: V \to M$ where $V$ is a neighborhood
    of the zero-cross section of $M$.
    % IFT
    Using the Inverse Function Theorem for smooth manifolds (see\cite[thm.4.5]{lee})
    for an arbitrary $(m, v) \in V$ it follows that $\exp$ is a local homeomorphism.
    Furthermore,
    % local homeomorphism -> homeomorphism
    $\exp$ maps $\set{(p, 0)}{0 \in T_pM}$ homeomorphically to $\Delta(M)$.
    Using the statement from \cite[lm.4.1]{whitehead} (manifolds are locally compact and seperable),
    it follows that $\exp$ maps a neighborhood
    of the zero-cross section to a neighborhood of the diagonal.
    % commutativity
    Commutativity between injection maps is given by
    \[ \exp(i_{\abs{\eta}}(p)) = \exp(p, 0) = (m, m) = \Delta(m) \]
    and between projection maps by
    \[ j_{\abs{\eta}}(p, v) = p = \pi_1(p, \snd{\exp}(p, v)) = \pi_1(\exp(p, v)), \]
    which concludes the proof.
\end{myproof}
