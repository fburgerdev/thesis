% lemma
\begin{mystatement}{lemma}{microbundle::local}
    The diagram $\bundle{B}{E}{i}{j}$ is locally trivial in $b \in B$
    if and only if there exists a homeomorphism
    \[ \phi: V \isomto \phi(V) \sub B \times \R^n \]
    where $V$ is a neighborhood of $i(b)$ and $\phi(V)$
    is neighborhood of $(b, 0)$ such that $\phi$ commutes
    as in \myintref{microbundle::definition}.
\end{mystatement}

% proof
\begin{myproof}
    It suffices to show that we can derive local triviality in $b$
    assuming only a homeomorphism $\phi: V \isomto \phi(V)$ as stated:

    % restrict
    Since $\phi(V)$ is a neighborhood of $(b, 0)$,
    there exists an open subset $U \sub B$ and $\eps > 0$ such
    that $U \times \ball[\eps] \sub \phi(V)$.

    % ball
    Note that there exists a homeomorphism
    \[ \mu_\eps: \ball[\eps] \isomto \R^n \twith \mu_\eps(0) = 0 \]
    for example by
    \[ x \mapsto \tan(\frac{\abs{x}\cdot\pi}{2\eps}) x. \]

    % construct
    We can now construct a local trivialization with
    \[ \phi': \inv{\phi}(U \times \ball[\eps]) \isomto U \times \R^n \]
    given by $\phi' = \mu_\eps \circ \phi$.

    % commutativity
    Commutativity between $i$ and $id \cross 0$ is given by
    \[ \phi'(i(b)) = \mu_\eps(phi(b)) = \mu_\eps(b, 0) = (b, 0) = (id \cross 0)(b) \]
    and between $j$ and $\pi_1$ by
    \[ j(e) = \pi_1(\phi(e)) = \pi_1(\mu_\eps(\phi(e))) = \pi_1(\phi'(e)), \]
    which concludes the proof.
