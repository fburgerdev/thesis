\begin{myparagraph}
    This subsection introduces the concept of microbundles
    along with some basic properties.
    We clarify what a microbundle is, what it means for a microbundle to be trivial and 
    cover some basic examples of microbundles, including the tangent microbundle over topological manifolds.

    Throughout this thesis,
    we require that every manifold is paracompact and second-countable.
    Unless explicitly stated,
    manifolds do not come equipped with a differentiable structure.
