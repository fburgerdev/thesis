\begin{myparagraph} In the remainder of this section, we show the above-mentioned theorem about the existence of an `inverse' in respect to the Whitney sum. This statement is essential for the proof of Milnors \Cref{normal::milnor}.

In order to show this, we require the following lemma, whose proof will be deferred until \myintref{chapter::suspension}.

\end{myparagraph}

\begin{mystatement}{lemma}[Bouquet Lemma]{whitney::bouquet}[59] Let $\bb$ be a microbundle over a `bouquet' of spheres $B$, meeting in a single point. Then there exists a map $r: B \to B$ such that $\whitney{\bb}{\ind{r}\bb}$ is trivial. \end{mystatement}

\begin{mystatement}{theorem}{whitney::theorem}[59] Let $\bb$ be a microbundle over a $d$-simplicial complex $B$. Then there exists a microbundle $\bn$ over $B$ such that the Whitney sum $\whitney{\bb}{\bn}$ is trivial. \end{mystatement}

\begin{myproof} We prove the theorem by induction over $d$.

(Start of induction)

A $1$-simplicial complex is just a bouquet of circles. Hence, the start of induction follows directly from \myintref{whitney::bouquet}.

(Inductive Step)

Let $B'$ be the $(d - 1)$-skeleton of $B$ and let $\bn'$ be its corresponding microbundle such that $\whitney{\bb[B']}{\bn'}$ is trivial.

\begin{steps} \item $\whitney{\bn'}{\be{B'}}$ can be extended over any $d$-simplex $\sigma$

Consider the equation \[ (\whitney{\bn'}{\be{B'}})\restr{\partial\sigma} = \whitney{\bn'\restr{\partial\sigma}}{\be{B'}\restr{\partial\sigma}} = \whitney{\bn'\restr{\partial\sigma}}{\bb[\partial\sigma]} = (\whitney{\bn'}{\bb[B']})\restr{\partial\sigma} \] in which we used \myintref{induced::simplex} for $\be{B'}\restr{\partial\sigma} = \bb[\partial\sigma]$. Since $(\whitney{\bn'}{\bb[B']})\restr{\partial\sigma}$ is trivial, the claim follows from \myintref{induced::simplex}.

\item $\whitney{\bn'}{\be{B'}}$ can be extended over $B$

One difficulty is that the individual $d$-simplices are not well-separated. To deal with this, we consider $B''$ which is defined to be $B$ with small open $d$-cells removed from every $d$-simplex. Since $B'$ is a retract of $B''$, we can extend $\whitney{\bn'}{\be{B'}}$ to a microbundle $\nu$ over $B''$.

Now we extend $\nu$ over $B$ by taking all extensions of $\nu$ over every simplex using (Step 1), and identifying its total spaces together along $E(\nu)$. Similarly, injection and projection are obtained by piecing the injection and projection maps of the individual extensions together.

We denote the resulting microbundle by $\eta$.

\item \blankbreak{} Consider the mapping cone $B \sqcup_\iota CB'$ over the inclusion $B' \incl B$. The following equation shows that $(\whitney{\bb}{\eta})\restr{B'}$ is trivial: \[ (\whitney{\bb}{\eta})\restr{B'} \cong \whitney{\bb[B']}{\eta\restr{B'}} \cong \whitney{\bb[B']}{(\whitney{\bn'}{\be{B'}})} \cong \whitney{(\whitney{\bb[B']}{\bn'})}{\be{B'}} \cong \whitney{\be{B'}}{\be{B'}} \] \myintref{induced::cone} then yields a microbundle $\xi$ over $B \sqcup_\iota CB'$ extending $\whitney{\bb}{\eta}$.

The mapping cone $B \sqcup_\iota CB'$ has the homotopy type of a bouquet of spheres, which can be seen as follows: \begin{itemize} \item A $d$-simplex is homotopic to a $d$-disc. \item A $d$-disc whose boundary is collapsed to a single point is a $d$-sphere. \item One can define a homotopy between $\iota(B')$ and the tip of the cone by traveling along $CB'$. \end{itemize}

Using \myintref{homotopy::theorem} and \myintref{whitney::bouquet}, we conclude that there exists a microbundle $\bn$ such that $(\whitney{\xi}{\bn})\restr{B}$ is trivial. The equation \[ \be{B} = (\whitney{\xi}{\bn})\restr{B} = \whitney{\xi\restr{B}}{\bn\restr{B}} = \whitney{(\whitney{\bb}{\eta})}{\bn\restr{B}} = \whitney{\bb}{(\whitney{\eta}{\bn\restr{B}})} \] completes the proof. \end{steps} \end{myproof}
