    % lemma
    \begin{mystatement}{lemma}{whitney::compatibility}
        Let $\bb_1$ and $\bb_1$ be two microbundles over $B$ and let $f: A \to B$ be a map.
        The induced microbundle and the Whitney sum are compatible, that is
        \begin{center}
            $\wleft \cong \wright$.
        \end{center}
    \end{mystatement}

    % proof
    \begin{myproof}
        % total space
        The total space $E(\wleft)$ is of the form
        \[ \{(a, (e_1, e_2)) \in A \cross (E(\bb_1) \cross E(\bb_2)) \mid j_1(e_1) = j_2(e_2) = f(a) \} \]
        and $E(\wright)$ is of the form
        \[ \set{((a_1, e_1), (a_2, e_2)) \in E(\ind{f}\bb_1) \cross E(\ind{f}\bb_2)}{j_1(a_1, e_1) = j(a_2, e_2)}. \]

        % homeomorphism
        We have a homeomorphsim $\phi: E(\wleft) \isomto E(\wright)$ with
        \[ \phi(a, (e_1, e_2)) = ((a, e_1), (a, e_2)) \]
        and its inverse
        \[ \inv{\phi}((a, e_1), (a, e_2)) = (a, (e_1, e_2)). \]
        The two total spaces are homeomorphic via
        $\phi(a, (e_1, e_2)) := ((a, e_1), (a, e_2))$ with $\inv{\phi}((a, e_1), (a, e_2)) = (a, (e_1, e_2))$.
        Homeomorphy of $\phi$ follows from the continuity of $\phi$ and $\inv{\phi}$,
        which is given since both $\phi$ and $\inv{\phi}$ are composed by identity maps.
        
        % commutativity
        Commutativity between the injection maps is given by
        \[ \phi(i_f(a)) = \phi(a, (i_1(f(a)), i_2(f(a)))) = ((a, i_1(f(a))), (a, i_2(f(a)))) = i_\oplus(a) \]
        and between the projection maps by
        \[ j_f(a, (e_1, e_2)) = a = j_\oplus((a, e_1), (a, e_2)) = j_\oplus(\phi(a, (e_1, e_2))), \]
        where $i_f$ and $j_f$ denote the injection and projection for $\wleft$
        and $i_\oplus$ and $j_\oplus$ denote the injection and projection for $\wright$.
