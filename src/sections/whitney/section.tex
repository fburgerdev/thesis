\begin{myparagraph} Given two vector bundles $E$ and $F$ over the same base space $X$, one can define the Whitney sum $\whitney{E}{F}$ by forming the direct sum of the individual fibers $E_x$ and $F_x$, hence the notation.

This construction carries over to microbundles, as elaborated in the following. The centerpiece of this section will be \myintref{whitney::theorem}, which states that for microbundles over simplicial complexes, one can find an `inverse' microbundle such that their Whitney sum is trivial. \end{myparagraph} \input{src/sections/whitney/parts/definition} \input{src/sections/whitney/parts/compatibility} \input{src/sections/whitney/parts/trivialize}
