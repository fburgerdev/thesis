\begin{myparagraph}
    This chapter introduces another central construction over microbundles, the `whitney sum'.
    Again, the construction and basic properties are similar to its vector bundle analogue.
    It allows us to construct a microbundle given two microbundles over the same base space.
    The fibre dimension of the resulting microbundle
    is just the sum of the fibre dimensions of the initial microbundles.
