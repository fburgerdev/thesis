\begin{mystatement}{definition}{suspension::induced}[57] Let $\bb$ be a rooted microbundle over $B$ and let $f: A \to B$ be a based map. We equip the induced microbundle $\ind{f}\bb$ with the rooting \[ \germdef{R_f}{E(\ind{f}\bb[a_0]) = a_0 \cross E(\bb[b_0])}{e^n_{a_0}} \] that coincides with $R$ if we consider $a_0 \cross E(\bb[b_0]) = E(\bb[b_0])$ and $e^n_{a_0} = e^n_{b_0}$. \end{mystatement}

\begin{myparagraph} The total space $E(\ind{f}\bb[a_0])$ is the same as $a_0 \cross E(\bbb)$ because \[ E(\ind{f}\bb[a_0]) = \set{(a, e) \in A \cross E(\bb)}{a = a_0 \tand f(a) = b_0 = j(e)} \] \[ = a_0 \cross \set{e \in E(\bb)}{j(e) = b_0} = a_0 \cross E(\bbb). \]

\end{myparagraph}
