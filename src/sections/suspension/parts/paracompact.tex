% lemma
\begin{mystatement}{lemma}{suspension::paracompact}
    Let $\bb$ be a rooted microbundle over a paracompact hausdorff space $B$.
    Then there exists a closed neighborhood $W$ of $b_0$ and an isomorphism-germ
    \[ \germ{\bb[W]}{\be{W}} \]
    extending $R$ (rooting of $\bb$) together with a map $\lambda: B \to [0, 1]$ with
    \[ \supp{\lambda} \sub W \tand \lambda(b_0) = 1. \]
\end{mystatement}

% proof
\begin{myproof}
    Let $r: V_r \to b_0 \cross \R^n$ be a representative for $R$.
    
    Choose a local trivialization $(U, V, \phi)$ for $b_0$ such that $V \cap E(\bbb) \sub V_r$.
    Such a trivialization can be obtained by subtracting the closed set
    $E(\bbb) - V_r$ from $E(\bb)$ if necessary
    and choosing a local trivialization for $b_0$ in the resulting microbundle instead.
    
    Consider the (locally) finite open cover of $B$ given by $U$ and $B - \{b_0\}$.
    Since $B$ is paracompact, we can apply the theory
    of partitions of unity which yields a map
    $\lambda: B \to [0, 1] \twith \supp{\lambda} \sub U$ and $\lambda(b_0) = 1$.

    We choose $W = \supp{\lambda} \sub U$,
    which is closed by the definition of the support.
    We are now able to define an isomorphism-germ $\germ{\bb[W]}{\be{W}}$ represented by
    \[ f: V \isomto f(V) \sub U \cross \R^n \twith f(e) = (j(e), \snd{r}(\inv{\phi}(b_0, \snd{\phi}(e)))), \]
    which extends $r$.

    Together with $\lambda$, this completes the proof.
