% foreword suspension
\begin{myparagraph}
    In the following, let $B$ be a \defterm{reduced suspension}
    \[ SX = (\cyl{X}) / (X \cross \coll{0, 1} \cup \cyl{x_0})\]
    over a topological space $X$.

    Let $\phi: B \to B \vee B$ denote the `duplicate' map given by
    \[ \phi([x, t]) = \case{([x, 2t], 1)}{([x, 2t - 1], 2)}{t \le \half}. \]

    Additionally, let $c_1: B \vee B \to B$ denote the map
    that is the identity on the first summand
    and the constant map $c_{B, b_0}$ on the second summand, i.e.
    \[ c_1(b, i) = \case{b}{b_0}{i = 1}. \]
    We define $c_2$ analogously.
