\begin{myparagraph}
    In the following,
    we provide a proof for the Bouquet Lemma presented in \myintref{section::whitney}.
    To this end, we introduce the concept of `rooted microbundles',
    which allows us to define the wedge sum of two microbundles in a precise manner.
    Additionally, we show a version of the Homotopy Theorem
    that is compatible with rooted-microbundles.

    In this section,
    we assume that every topological space is equipped with an arbitrary base point
    which we will denote with subscript $0$.
