\begin{myparagraph}
    In this chapter, we provide the proof for \myintref{whitney::bouqet}.
    Along the way, we introduce `rooted-microbundles' which are
    microbundles with a little more structure, show a slightly sharper version of
    the Homotopy Theorem and study the wedge sum of two rooted microbundles.

    Throughout the chapter,
    we assume that every topological space comes with an arbitray base point which
    we will denote with a $0$ subscript.
