\begin{myparagraph}
    In this chapter, we provide a proof for the Bouquet Lemma in \ref{whitney::bouquet}.
    For this purpose we introduce so called `rooted microbundles'.
    They allow us to properly define the wedge sum of two microbundles.
    We will also show a version of the Homotopy Theorem
    that is compatible with rooted-microbundles.

    Throughout this chapter,
    we assume that every topological space comes with an arbitrary base point
    which we will denote with subscript $0$.
