\begin{myparagraph}
    Every topological manifold is an absolute neighborhood retract (ANR).
    
    It follows that by restricting $M$, if necessary, to an open neighborhood of $N$,
    there exists a retraction $M \subm N$.

    From now on, let
    \[ r: M \subm N \]
    denote such a retraction and let
    \[ \iota: N \incl M \]
    denote the inclusion $N \sub M$.
