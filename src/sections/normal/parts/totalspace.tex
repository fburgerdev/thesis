% foreword
\begin{myparagraph}
    The total space $E(\ind{r}\bt_N)$ is a topological manifold.
    This can be seen with
    \[ E(\ind{r}\bt_N) = \set{(v, n_1, n_2) \in V \cross (N \cross N)}{r(v) = n_1} \cong V \cross N. \]

    Together with $N \incl M \xto{i_{\bt}} E(\ind{r}\bt_N)$, we can assume that
    $N$ is an embedded submanifold of $E(\ind{r}\bt_N)$.
    Note that $i_{\bt}$ is an embedding due to the construction of the induced microbundle.
\end{myparagraph}

% lemma
\begin{mystatement}{lemma}{normal::total}[62]
    Let $N \sub M$ be an embedded submanifold and let $r: V \to N$ be a retraction.
    Then there exists a normal microbundle $\bn$ of $N$ in $E(\ind{r}\bt_N)$. % such that $\bn \cong \ind{\iota}\bt_V$.
\end{mystatement}

% proof
\begin{myproof}
    We are given a normal microbundle of $N$ in $E(\ind{r}\bt_N)$ by $\ind{r}\bt_N\restr{N}$.
    
    Since $\ind{r}\bt_N\restr{N} \cong \ind{(r \circ \iota)}\bt_N = \ind{id}\bt_N \cong \bt_N$,
    it suffices to show that $\bt_N \cong \ind{\iota}\bt_V$.
    % homoemorphism
    We define a homeomorphism $\psi: E(\bt_N) \isomto E(\ind{\iota}\bt_V)$ with
    \[ \psi(n_1, n_2) = (n_1, n_1, n_2) \tand \inv{\psi}(n, v_1, v_2) = (n, v_2) \]
    for which homeomorphy follows from component-wise
    continuity of both $\psi$ and $\inv{\psi}$.
    
    % commutativity
    Commutativity with the injection maps is given by
    \[ \psi(\Delta(n)) = \psi(n, n) = (n, n, n) = (n, \Delta(n)) = i_\iota(n) \]
    and with the projection maps by
    \[ \pi_1(n_1, n_2) = n_1 = j_\iota(n_1, n_1, n_2) = j_\iota(\psi(n_1, n_2)), \]
    which concludes the proof.
    
    % Furthermore, $\ind{r}\bt_N\restr{N}$ is isomorphic to $\ind{\iota}\bt_V$ is given by
    % \[ \psi: E(\ind{\iota}\bt_V) \isomto E(\ind{r}\bt_N). \]
    % where commutativity with the injection and projection maps
    % follow from the diagram in \myintref{normal::commute} and from the following equation:
    % \[ j_\iota(n, v_1, v_2) = n = j_r(v_2) \]
\end{myproof}
