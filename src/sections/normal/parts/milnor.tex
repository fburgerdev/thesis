    % foreword
    % \begin{myparagraph}
    %     Finally, we gathered all the tools to prove Milnors theorem.
    % \end{myparagraph}

    % theorem
    \begin{mystatement}{theorem}[Milnors Theorem]{normal::milnor}[62]
        Let $N \sub M$ be a submanifold.
        For a sufficiently large $q \in \N$, $N = \cyldown{N}$ has a normal microbundle in $M \cross \R^q$.
    \end{mystatement}

    % proof
    \begin{myproof}
        We assume that $M$ is embedded in Euclidean space $\R^{2m + 1}$ \cite[p.60]{dimension}.
        Additionally, let $V$ be an open neighborhood of $N$ in $M$ together with a retraction $r: V \to N$.

        We show the theorem in multiple steps.
        \begin{steps}
            % step 1
            \item $N$ has a normal microbundle $\eta$ in $M$ such that $\whitney{\bt_N}{\eta} \cong \be[q]{N}$
            
            Consider the extension $\ind{r}\bt_N$ for $\bt_N$.
            Since $V$ is an open set, it's a simplicial complex.
            Hence, we can apply \myintref{whitney::theorem} to $\ind{r}\bt_N$
            to obtain a microbundle $\eta'$ such that $\whitney{\ind{r}\bt_N}{\eta'} \cong \be[q]{V}$.

            We conclude that $\whitney{\bt_N}{\eta'\restr{N}} = \whitney{\ind{r}\bt_N\restr{N}}{\eta'\restr{N}} \cong (\whitney{\ind{r}\bt_N}{\eta'})\restr{N} \cong \be[q]{N}$.

            % step 2
            \item $E(\rtn)$ has a normal microbundle in $E(\rwhitney)$

            Note that $\rwhitney \cong \ind{r}(\whitney{\bt_N}{\eta})$ is trivial.
            Hence, by restricting the total space $E(\rwhitney)$ if necessary,
            we may assume that
            \[ E(\rwhitney) = V \cross \R^q \]
            for some $q \in \N$.
            Particularly, we derive that $E(\rwhitney)$ is a manifold.

            We denote the injection and projection of $\rtn$ by $i_{\bt}$ and $j_{\bt}$,
            and the injection and projection of $\ind{r}\eta$ by $i_{\eta}$ and $j_{\eta}$.

            We consider $E(\rtn)$ to be a submanifold of $E(\rwhitney)$ embedded by
            \[ e \mapsto (e, j_{r}(i_{\eta}(e))). \]
            We have a normal microbundle of $E(\rtn)$ in $E(\rwhitney)$ given by $\ind{j_{\bt}}(\ind{r}\eta)$.
            That is because the total space
            \[ E(\ind{j_r}(\ind{r}\eta)) = \set{(e, e') \in E(\rtn) \cross E(\ind{r}\eta)}{j_{\bt}(e) = j_\eta(e')} \]
            equals $E(\rwhitney)$ and because its inclusion matches the above embedding.
            
            % step 3
            \item $N$ has a normal microbundle in $M \times \R^q$
            
            Since $N$ has a normal microbundle in $E(\rtn)$ (\myintref{microbundle::total})
            and $E(\rtn)$ has a normal microbundle in $E(\rwhitney)$,
            we conclude with \myintref{normal::transitivity} that
            $N$ has a normal microbundle in $E(\rwhitney)$.
            
            As elaborated in Step 2, we may assume that $E(\rwhitney) = V \cross \R^n$.
            Since $V$ is open in $M$, $V \cross \R^n$ is open in $M \cross \R^n$.
        \end{steps}
        We conclude that $N$ has a normal microbundle in $M \cross \R^n$.
    \end{myproof}

    % dimension
    \begin{myparagraph}
        With the provided proofs for \myintref{whitney::theorem} and \myintref{normal::milnor},
        we can calculate an upper bound $m(2^{2m + 2} - 2)$ for $q$, where $m$ is the dimension of $M$ \cite[p.63]{milnor}.
        However, when provided with sharper proofs,
        one can substantially reduce the upper bound
        to a quadratic $(m + 1)^2 - 1$ (see \cite[p.232]{hirsch}).
