\subsection*{Milnors Theorem}\label{section::milnor}
\begin{myparagraph}
Lastly, we will take us of all the substantial
results presented in this thesis in order to prove Milnors \myintref{normal::milnor}.

\begin{myparagraph}
For the remainder of this section,
we utilize the fact that for every submanifold $N \sub M$,
$N$ is an absolute neighborhood retract (ANR) in $M$,
i.e, there exists an open neighborhood $V \sub M$ of $N$
together with a retraction $r: V \to N$.
For a proof, see Theorem 3.3 in \cite{hanner}.
