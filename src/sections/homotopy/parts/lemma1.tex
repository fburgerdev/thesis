    % lemma
    \begin{mystatement}{lemma}{homotopy::lemma1}[67]
        Let $\bb$ be a microbundle over $\cyl{B}$.
        If $\bbleft$ and $\bbright$ are both trivial,
        then $\bb$ itself is trivial.
    \end{mystatement}

    % proof
    \begin{myproof}
        Consider the identity bundle-germ over $\bbhalf$,
        which is defined as the bundle-germ represented by the identity map on $E(\bbhalf)$.
        
        Since $\bbright$ and $\bbhalf$ are both trivial,
        there exist isomorphism-germs
        \[
            \germdef{R}{\bbright}{\be{B {\cross} [\half, 1]}} \tand
            \germdef{L}{\bbhalf}{\be{B {\cross} \coll{\half}}}.
        \]
        We define a bundle-germ $\germdef{M}{\be{B \cross [\half, 1]}}{\be{B \cross \coll{\half}}}$
        represented by
        \[ (b, t, x) \mapsto (b, \half, x). \]
        The composition $\inv{L} \circ M \circ R$ then yields a bundle-germ $\germ{\bbright}{\bbhalf}$
        that extends the identity on $\bbhalf$.

        Using the previous lemma, we can glue this together with the
        identity over $\bbleft$
        (note that the bundle-germs agree on $\bbhalf$)
        resulting in a bundle-germ $\germ{\bb}{\bbleft}$.

        \myintref{homotopy::corollary} infers that $\bb$
        is isomorphic to $\ind{r}\bbleft$
        where
        \[ r: \cyl{B} \to B \cross [0, \half] \twith r(b, t) = (b, \min(t, \half)). \]
        But $\bbleft$ is trivial, hence $\ind{r}\bbleft$ is
        trivial as well (see \myintref{induced::trivial}).
        We conclude that $\bb$ is trivial.
    \end{myproof}
