\begin{mystatement}{lemma}{homotopy::paracompact}
    Let $B$ be a paracompact space and let $\coll{V_\alpha}$
    be a locally finite open cover of $B$.
    Then there exists a locally finite closed cover $\coll{\overline{B_\beta}}$ of $B$
    such that every $\overline{B_\beta}$ intersects with only
    finitely many $V_{\alpha_1}, \dots V_{\alpha_n}$.
\end{mystatement}

% proof
\begin{myproof}
    For every $b \in B$, there exists an open neighborhood $U_b$ of $b$
    that intersects with only finitely many
    $V_{\alpha_1}, \dots V_{\alpha_k}$
    due to local finiteness of $\coll{V_\alpha}$.
    Clearly, the collection $\coll{U_b}$ over all $b \in B$ covers $B$.

    Since $B$ is paracompact, there exists a locally finite subcover $\coll{B_\beta}$.

    The collection $\coll{\overline{B_\beta}}$ then meets our requirements:
    \begin{sectionize}
        \item $\coll{\overline{B_\beta}}$ is locally finite
        
        For an arbitrary $b \in B$, let $W_b$
        be an open neighborhood of $b$ that
        intersects only finitely many $B_{\beta_1}, \dots, B_{\beta_k}$.
        Now $W_b$ intersects only
        $\overline{B_{\beta_1}}, \dots, \overline{B_{\beta_1}}$, because
        \[ W_b \cap B_\beta = \emptyset \]
        \[ \implies B_\beta \sub B - W_b \]
        \[ \implies \overline{B_\beta} \sub \overline{B - W_b} = B - W_b \]
        \[ \implies W_b \cap \overline{B_\beta} = \emptyset. \]

        \item Every $\overline{B_\beta}$ intersects
        only finitely many $V_{\alpha_1}, \dots V_{\alpha_k}$
        
        Since $B_\beta \sub U_b$ for some $b \in B$, $B_\beta$
        intersects only finitely many $V_{\alpha_1}, \dots V_{\alpha_k}$.
        By applying the same reasoning as in (1),
        it follows that $\overline{B_\beta}$ intersects
        with the same $V_{\alpha_1}, \dots V_{\alpha_k}$.
    \end{sectionize}
