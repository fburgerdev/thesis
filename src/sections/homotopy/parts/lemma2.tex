    Let $\bb$ be a microbundle over $\cyl{B}$.
    Then every $b \in B$ has a neighborhood $V$ such that $\bb[\cyl{V}]$ is trivial.
\end{mystatement}

% proof
\begin{myproof}
    Let $b \in B$ be arbitrary.

    For every $t \in \I$, assume a neighborhood
    $U_t = V_t \cross (t - \eps_t, t + \eps_t)$ of $(b, t)$
    such that $\bb[U_t]$ is trivial.
    Such a $U_t$ can be constructed by taking
    a local trivialization $(U', V', \phi')$ of $(b, t)$ in $\bb$
    and restricting $U'$ accordingly.

    Since $\cyl{\coll{b}}$ is compact, we can choose a finitely many
    \[ (V_1 \cross (t_1 - \eps_1, t_1 + \eps_1)), \dots, (V_n \cross (t_n - \eps_n, t_n + \eps_n)) \]
    of the collection $\{U_t\}$ covering $\{b\} \cross \I$ and define $V = V_1 \cap \dots \cap V_n$.

    The restricted microbundles $\bb[V \cross (t_i - \eps_i, t_i + \eps_i)]$ are trivial, because every $\bb[U_t]$ is trivial and $V \cross (t_i - \eps_i, t_i + \eps_i) \sub U_t$.
    Hence, there exists a subdivision $0 = t_0 < \cdots < t_k = 1$ such that every $\bb[V \cross [t_{i}, t_{i + 1}]]$ is trivial.
    
    By iteratively applying the previous lemma on the $\bb[V \cross [t_i, t_{i + 1}]]$, it follows that $\bb[\cyl{V}]$ is trivial.
