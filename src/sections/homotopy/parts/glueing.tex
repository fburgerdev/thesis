% lemma
\begin{mystatement}{lemma}{homotopy::gluing}[67]
    % conditions
    Let $\bb$ be a microbundle over $B$ and let $\coll{B_\alpha}$
    be a locally finite collection of closed sets covering $B$.
    Additionally, we are given a collection
    of bundle-germs $\germdef{F_\alpha}{\bb[B_\alpha]}{\bb'}$
    such that $F_\alpha = F_\beta$ on $\bb[B_\alpha \cap B_\beta]$.
    % conclusion
    Then there exists a bundle-germ $\germdef{F}{\bb}{\bb'}$ extending $F_\alpha$,
    that is, representatives for $F$ and $F_\alpha$ agree on a sufficiently small neighborhood of $i(B_\alpha)$.
\end{mystatement}

% proof
\begin{myproof}
    Choose representative maps $f_\alpha: U_\alpha \to E(\bb')$ for $F_\alpha$ such that the $U_\alpha$ are open.
    For every $\alpha$ and $\beta$, choose an open neighborhood $U_{\alpha\beta}$ of $i(B_\alpha \cap B_\beta)$ on which the representative maps $f_\alpha$ and $f_\beta$ agree.
    Now consider
    \[ U = \set{ e \in E(\bb)}{j(e) \in B_\alpha \cap B_\beta \implies e \in U_{\alpha\beta}} \]
    which is an open neighborhood of $i(B)$:
    \begin{enumerate}
        % open
        \item $U$ is open

        Let $e \in U$ be arbitrary.

        Since $\coll{B_\alpha}$ is locally finite,
        there exists an open neighborhood $V$ of $j(e)$
        that intersects with only finitely many $B_{\alpha_1}, \dots, B_{\alpha_n}$.
        Note that from $e \in U$ it follows that $e \in U_{\alpha_i\alpha_j}, \forall 1 \le i, j \le n$.

        We are given an open neighborhood of $e$ by
        \[ \bigcap_{1 \le i, j \le n} U_{\alpha_i\alpha_j} \cap \inv{j}(V), \]
        which is contained in $U$ by construction.

        % subset
        \item $i(B) \sub U$
        
        This follows from
        $j(i(b)) = b \in B_\alpha \cap B_\beta \implies i(b) \in i(B_\alpha \cap B_\beta) \sub U_{\alpha\beta}$.
    \end{enumerate}
    We define a map $f: U \to E(\bb')$ by
    \[ f(e \in U_{\alpha\beta}) = f_\alpha(e) = f_\beta(e) \]
    which is well-defined due to the construction of $U$.
    Note that $f$ agrees with every $f_\alpha$ on their intersection
    and is continuous as
    \[ \inv{f}(V) = \bigcup_{\alpha} \inv{f_\alpha\restr{U}}(V). \]
    Taking $f$ as a representative for a bundle-germ $\germdef{F}{\bb}{\bb'}$
    completes the proof.
