\begin{mystatement}{lemma}{homotopy::lemma3}[67] Let $\bb$ be a microbundle over $\cyl{B}$ where $B$ is paracompact hausdorff. Then there exists a bundle-germ $\germdef{R}{\bb}{\bb[\cylup{B}]}$ covering the retraction $r: \cyl{B} \to \cylup{B}$ with $r(b, t) = (b, 1)$. \end{mystatement}

\begin{myproof} First, we assume a locally finite covering $\{V_\alpha\}$ of open sets where $\bb[\cyl{V_\alpha}]$ is trivial. The existence of such a covering is justified by \myintref{homotopy::lemma2} and paracompactness of $B$.

This cover can be equipped with a partition of unity \[ \lambda_\alpha: B \to \I \twith \supp \lambda_\alpha \sub V_\alpha \] since $B$ is paracompact hausdorff, that is rescaled in way that \[ \max_\alpha(\lambda_\alpha(b)) = 1, \forall b \in B. \] Such a rescaling can be achieved by dividing $\lambda_\alpha$ by $\max_\alpha \lambda_\alpha$ which is well-defined because $\coll{V_\alpha}$ is locally finite and continuous because the $\max$ function is continuous. Also, $\max_\alpha \lambda_\alpha(b) > 0$ since the initial partition of unity adds up to $1$ in every point.

Now we define a retraction $r_\alpha: \cyl{B} \to \cyl{B}$ with \[ r_\alpha(b, t) = (b, \max(t, \lambda_\alpha(b))). \]

In the remainder of this proof, we construct bundle-germs $\germdef{R_\alpha}{\bb}{\bb}$ covering $r_\alpha$ in order to `compose' them to our required bundle-germ. \begin{sectionize} \item Constructing bundle-germs $R_\alpha$ covering $r_\alpha$

We can divide $B \cross \I$ into two subsets \[ A_\alpha = \cyl{\supp{\lambda_\alpha}} \sub \cyl{V_\alpha} \tand A'_\alpha = \set{(b, t)}{t \ge \lambda_\alpha(b)}. \] Since $\bb[A_\alpha]$ is trivial, we can, analogous to the proof of \myintref{homotopy::lemma1}, extend the identity bundle-germ on $\bb[\A \cap \A']$ to a bundle-germ \[ \germ{\bb[\A]}{\bb[\A \cap \A']} \] using the bundle-germ $\germ{\be{\A}}{\be{\A \cap \A'}}$ represented by \[ (a, x) \mapsto (r_\alpha(a), x). \] Pieced together with the identity bundle-germ $\bb[\A']$ ($\A$ and $\A'$ are both closed), we obtain a bundle-germ $R_\alpha$ covering $r_\alpha$.

\item Constructing a bundle-germ $R$ covering $(b, t) \mapsto (b, 1)$

Applying the well-ordering theorem, which is equivalent to the axiom of choice (see\cite[p.14]{kuczma}), we may assume an ordering for $\coll{V_\alpha}$.

Let $\coll{B_\beta}$ be a locally finite closed cover of $B$ such that $B_\beta$ intersects only finitely many $V_{\alpha_1} < \cdots < V_{\alpha_k}$ obtained by \myintref{homotopy::paracompact}.

The composition $R_{\alpha_1} \circ \ldots \circ R_{\alpha_k}$ restricts to a bundle-germ \[ \germdef{R(\beta)}{\bb[\cyl{B_\beta}]}{\bb[\cylup{B_\beta}]} \] covering the retraction $(b, t) \mapsto (b, 1)$. That is because for every $b \in B_\beta$, we find an $1 \le i \le k$ with $\lambda_{\alpha_i}(b) = 1$ and hence $r_{\alpha_i}(b, t) = (b, 1)$.

Pieced together using \myintref{homotopy::lemma1}, we obtain a bundle-germ \[ R: \bb[\cyl{B}] \to \bb[\cylup{B}] \] covering $(b, t) \mapsto (b, 1)$. \end{sectionize} \end{myproof} \end{scope}
