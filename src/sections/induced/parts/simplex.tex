\begin{myparagraph}
    We can derive a statement from this about extending a microbundle over a simplex
    by utilizing that the cone of the boundary of a simplex 
    is homeomorphic to the simplex itself.
\end{myparagraph}

% corollary
\begin{mystatement}{corollary}{induced::simplex}
    Let $B$ be a $(d + 1)$-simplicial complex, $B'$ its $d$-skeleton and $\Delta \sub B$ a $(d + 1)$-simplex.
    A microbundle $\bb$ over $B'$ can be extended to a microbundle over $B' \cup \Delta$
    if and only if its restriction to the boundary $\bb[\partial \Delta]$ is trivial.
\end{mystatement}

% proof
\begin{myproof}
    With $f: \partial \Delta \incl B'$ and the previous lemma,
    it follows that there exists a microbundle $\bb'$ over $B' \cup_f C\partial\Delta$ extending $\bb$
    if and only if $\ind{f}\bb = \bb[\partial\Delta]$ is trivial.

    We have a homeomorphism $\phi: C\partial \Delta \isomto \Delta$ with
    \[ \phi((t_1, \dots, t_{d + 1}), \lambda) = (1 - \lambda) (t_1, \dots, t_{d + 1}) + \frac{\lambda}{d + 1} (1, \dots, 1). \]
    Particulary, $\phi(\partial \Delta \cross \{0\}) = \partial \Delta$.

    It follows that $B' \cup_f C \partial\Delta \cong B' \cup \Delta$, which concludes the proof.
