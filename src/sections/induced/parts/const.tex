% lemma
\begin{mystatement}{lemma}{induced::const}
    Let $\bb$ be a microbundle over $B$.
    The induced microbundle $\ind{c_{A, b_0}}\bb$ over a constant map
    \[ c_{A, b_0}: A \to B \twith c_{A, b_0}(a) = b_0 \]
    is trivial.
\end{mystatement}

% proof
\begin{myproof}
    % homeomorphism
    The total space $E(\ind{c_{A, b_0}}\bb)$ is defined as
    \[ \set{(a, e) \in A \cross E(\bb)}{f(a) = b_0 = j(e)} = A \cross \inv{j}(b_0). \]

    Let $(U, V, \phi)$ be local trivialization for $b_0$ in $\bb$.
    Restricting $\phi$ to the fiber $\inv{j}(b_0)$ yields a homeomorphism
    \[ \phi\restr{\inv{j}(b_0)}: V \cap \inv{j}(b_0) \isomto b_0 \times \R^n \]
    It follows that $\psi: A \cross (V \cap \inv{j}(b_0)) \isomto A \cross \R^n$ with
    \[ \psi(a, e) = (a, \snd{\phi}(e)) \]
    is a homeomorphism as well.

    % neighborhoods
    The product $A \cross (V \cap \inv{j}(b_0))$ is open in $E(\ind{c_{A, b_0}}\bb)$,
    since  $V \cap \inv{j}(b_0)$ is open in $\inv{j}(b_0)$ with the subspace topology.
    Additionally, from
    \[ i_{c}(a) = (a, i(c_{A, b_0}(a))) = (a, i(b_0)) \tand \snd{\phi}(i(b_0)) = 0 \]
    it follows that $A \cross (V \cap \inv{j}(b_0))$ is a neighborhood of $\cyldown{A}$.
    So $\psi$ maps a neighborhood of $i_c(A)$
    to a neighborhood of $\cyldown{A}$.
    
    % commutativity
    Commutativity between the injection maps is given by
    \[ \psi(i_c(a)) = \psi(a, i(b_0)) = (a, \snd{\phi}(i(b_0))) = (a, 0) = (id \cross 0)(a) \]
    and between the projection maps by
    \[ j_c(a, e) = a = \pi_1(a, x) = \pi_1(\psi(a, e)). \]

    Hence, $\ind{c_{A, b_0}}\bb$ and $\be{A}$ are isomorphic via $\psi$.
