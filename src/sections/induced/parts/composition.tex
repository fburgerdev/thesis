Let $A \xto{f} B \xto{g} C$ be topological spaces and $\mathfrak{c}: \bundle{C}{E}{i}{j}$ be a microbundle:
\[ (g \circ f)^*\mathfrak{c} \cong f^*(g^*\mathfrak{c}) \]
% proof
\begin{proof}
We'll compare the two total spaces and conclude that they are homeomorphic.
\begin{enumerate}
    \item $E((g \circ f)^*\mathfrak{c}) = \{ (a, e) \in A \times E(\mathfrak{c}) \mid g(f(a)) = j(e)\}$ 
    \item $E(f^*(g^*\mathfrak{c})) = \{ (a, (b, e)) \in A \times (B \times E(\mathfrak{c})) \mid f(a) = b$ and $ g(b) = j(e) \}$.
\end{enumerate}
We have the bijection $\phi: E((g \circ f)^*\mathfrak{c}) \isomto E(f^*(g^*\mathfrak{c}))$ with $\phi(a, e) := (a, (f(a), e))$ and $\phi^{-1}(a, (b, e)) = (a, e)$.
Additionally, $\phi$ is a homeomorphism because $\phi$ and $\phi^{-1}$ are componentwise continuous.
It's easy to see that $\phi$ respects both injection and projection, which concludes the proof.
