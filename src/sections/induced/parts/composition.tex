\begin{myparagraph}
    The following lemma shows that induced microbundles are compatible
    with map composition.
\end{myparagraph}

% lemma
\begin{mystatement}{lemma}{induced::composition}
    Let $\bundledef{\bc}{C}{E}{i}{j}$ be a microbundle and let $A \xto{f} B \xto{g} C$ be a map diagram.
    Then the two microbundles
    \[ \bundledef{\ind{(g \circ f)}\bc}{A}{E_1}{i_1}{j_1} \tand \bundledef{\ind{f}(\ind{g}\bc)}{A}{E_2}{i_2}{j_2} \]
    are isomorphic.
\end{mystatement}

% proof
\begin{myproof}
    % homoemorphism
    First, compare the two total spaces:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item $E(\ind{(g \circ f)}) = \{ (a, e) \in A \cross E \mid g(f(a)) = j(e)\}$ 
        \item $E(\ind{f}(\ind{g}\bc)) = \{ (a, b, e) \in A \cross (B \cross E) \mid f(a) = b$ and $ g(b) = j(e) \}$
    \end{itemize}
    We define a homeomorphism $\psi: E(\ind{(g \circ f)}) \isomto E(\ind{f}(\ind{g}\bc))$ with
    \[ \psi(a, e) = (a, f(a), e) \tand \inv{\psi}(a, b, e) = (a, e) \]
    which is a homeomorphism since both $\psi$ and $\inv{\psi}$ are component-wise continuous.
    % commutativity
    Commutativity with the injection maps is given by
    \[ \psi(i_1(a)) = \psi(a, i(g(f(a)))) = (a, f(a), i(g(f(a)))) = i_2(a) \]
    and with the projection maps by
    \[ j_1(a, e) = a = j_2(a, f(a), e) = j_2(\psi(a, e)), \]
    which concludes the proof.
\end{myproof}
