    One would intuitively argue that the induced microbundle is compatible
    with the composition of maps, i.e.
    $\ind{(g \circ f)}\bc \cong \ind{f}(\ind{g}\bc)$.
    This in fact true, as the following lemma shows.
\end{myparagraph}

% lemma
\begin{mystatement}{lemma}{induced::composition}
    Let $\bundledef{\bc}{C}{E}{i}{j}$ be a microbundle and let $A \xto{f} B \xto{g} C$ be a map diagram.
    Then the two microbundles
    \[ \bundledef{\ind{(g \circ f)}\bc}{A}{E_1}{i_1}{j_1} \]
    and
    \[ \bundledef{\ind{f}(\ind{g}\bc)}{A}{E_2}{i_2}{j_2} \]
    are isomorphic.
\end{mystatement}

% proof
\begin{myproof}
    % foreword
    Again, we need to find a homeomorphism between a neighborhood of $i_1(A)$ and a neighborhood of $i_2(A)$
    that commutes with the injection and projection maps.
    
    % homoemorphism
    Firstly, we compare the two total spaces:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item $E(\ind{(g \circ f)}) = \{ (a, e) \in A \cross E \mid g(f(a)) = j(e)\}$ 
        \item $E(\ind{f}(\ind{g}\bc)) = \{ (a, b, e) \in A \cross (B \cross E) \mid f(a) = b$ and $ g(b) = j(e) \}$
    \end{itemize}
    We define a homeomorphism $\psi: E(\ind{(g \circ f)}) \isomto E(\ind{f}(\ind{g}\bc))$ with
    \[ \psi(a, e) = (a, f(a), e) \tand \inv{\psi}(a, b, e) = (a, e) \]
    for which homeomorphy follows from component-wise
    continuity of both $\psi$ and $\inv{\psi}$.

    % commutativity
    Commutativity between the injection maps is given by
    \[ \psi(i_1(a)) = \psi(a, i(g(f(a)))) = (a, f(a), i(g(f(a)))) = i_2(a) \]
    and between the projection maps by
    \[ j_1(a, e) = a = j_2(a, f(a), e) = j_2(\psi(a, e)) \]
    which concludes the proof.
\end{myproof}
