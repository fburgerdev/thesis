\begin{mystatement}{lemma}{induced::trivial}
    Let $\bb$ be a microbundle over $B$ and $f: A \to B$ be a map.
    The induced microbundle $\ind{f}\bb$ is trivial if $\bb$ is already trivial.
\end{mystatement}

% proof
\begin{myproof}
    % explanation
    To proof triviality, we need to show that there exists a homeomorphism between a neighborhood of $i'(A)$ and $\cyldown{A}$
    that commutes with the injection and projection maps of $\ind{f}\bb$ and $\be{A}$.
    
    % homeomorphism
    Since $\bb$ is trivial, there exists a homeomorphism $\psi: V \to \psi(V)$
    where $V$ is a neighborhood of $i(B)$ and $\psi(V)$ is a neighborhood of $B \cross \{0\}$
    such that $\psi$ commutes with the injection and projection maps of $\bb$ and $\be{A}$.
    
    We define a map 
    \[ \psi_f: V_f \isomto \psi_f(V_f) \twith \psi_f(a, e) = (a, \snd{\psi}(e)), \]
    where $V_f = (A \cross V) \cap E(\ind{f}\bb)$.
    The existance of an inverse
    \[ \inv{\psi_f}(a, x) = (a, \inv{\psi}(f(a), x)) \]
    and component-wise continuity for both $\psi_f$ and $\inv{\psi_f}$
    show that $\psi_f$ is a homeomorphism.
    
    % neighborhoods
    The subset $V_f$ is a neighborhood of $i_f(A)$ since
    \[ i_f(a) = (a, i(f(a))) \tand i(f(a)) \in V. \]
    From $\snd{\psi}(i(f(a))) = 0$ and openness of $\psi_f$
    it follows that $\psi_f(V_f)$ is a neighborhood of $\cyldown{A}$.
    Hence, $\psi_f$ maps a neighborhood of $i_f(A)$
    to a neighborhood of $\cyldown{A}$, just as required.

    % commutativity
    Finally, commutativity between the injection maps is given by
    \[ \psi_f(i'(a)) = (a, \snd{\psi}(i(f(a)))) = (a, 0) = (id \cross 0)(a) \]
    and between the projection maps by
    \[ j_f(a, e) = a = \pi_1(a, \snd{\psi_f}(a, e)) = \pi_1(\psi_f(a, e)), \]
    which completes the proof.
