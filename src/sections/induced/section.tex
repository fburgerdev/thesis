\begin{myparagraph} Given a microbundle $\bb$ over $B$ and a map $f: A \to B$, one can define a microbundle $\ind{f}\bb$ over $A$. This is achieved by `pulling back' the base space $B$ to $A$ with the use of the map $f$.

After showing the existence of such a microbundle, we prove some basic properties such as triviality criteria and compatibility with map composition. Afterwards, we study induced microbundles over cones and simplicial complexes. \end{myparagraph} \input{src/sections/induced/parts/definition} \input{src/sections/induced/parts/restriction} \begin{myparagraph} Next, we provide two criteria to show that an induced microbundle is trivial. \end{myparagraph} \input{src/sections/induced/parts/trivial} \input{src/sections/induced/parts/const} \input{src/sections/induced/parts/composition} \input{src/sections/induced/parts/cone} \input{src/sections/induced/parts/simplex}
