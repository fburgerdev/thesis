    In differential geometry,
    the tangent space and normal space of a smooth manifolds are
    essential in understanding its geometry.

    One can define the tangent space
    in a particular point $p$ using derivations
    \[ T_p M = \set{\nu: C^\infty(M) \to \R^n \text{ linear}}{\nu(fg) = f(p)\nu(g) + \nu(f)g(p)} \]    
    or using tangent curves
    \[ T_p M = \set{\gamma \in C^\infty((-1, 1), M)}{\gamma(0) = p } / \sim \]
    where $\gamma \sim \gamma' \iff \frac{d}{dx}(\psi \circ \gamma)(0) = \frac{d}{dx}(\psi \circ \gamma)(0)$.
    
    The tangent space in a point yields the tangent bundle
    \[ TM := \bigsqcup_{p \in M} T_p M\]
    together with a section
    \[ TM \xto{\pi} M \twith \pi(p, \nu) = p. \]

    Lets say one wants to define a tangent bundle over a topological manifold
    without given any smooth structure.
    As we have seen that for the definition of the tangent space,
    one needs the notion of differentiability.

    This means that we can only define a concept over topological manifolds
    that is similar to the one over smooth manifolds.
    In the paper `Microbundles I.', J. Milnor introduces a way
    to define a tangent bundle over topological manifolds.
    This tangent bundle however is not a vector bundle as for the smooth case,
    instead the tangent bundle is a so called `microbundle' which is a weakening of
    the concept of a vector bundle.

    One can transfer many constructions from the classical vector bundle over to the microbundle,
    for example the whitney sum or the induced bundle. 

    But Milnor goes even further by also defining
    normal bundles over topological manifolds.

    In the smooth case, given an embedded submanifold $P \sub N$,
    the normal space in a point $p$
    is defined to be the quotient
    \[ N_p P = T_p M / T_p N. \]
    So we are always given a normal bundle $NP$ between two smooth manifolds $P \sub M$.

    This isn't true for normal microbundles.

    However, Milnor shows that one can always find a normal microbundle
    between the submanifold $P$ and a tubular space $M \times \R^q$
    for a sufficiently large $q \in \N$.

    Proving this statement and introducing the concept of
    microbundles along the way will be the content of this thesis.

    This thesis is based on the works of Milnor,
    adopting much of its structure and proofs.
    However, often we will provide more details,proving every single statement explicitly.
